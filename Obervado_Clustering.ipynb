We could do a better job of planning if we did, and if not you just leave people scrambling to kind of figure it all out on their own.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRicketts also expressed concern that the Biden administration and CDC\\\\u2019s surprise announcement could hurt efforts to expand vaccinations by giving people already skeptical of the vaccine more reason to avoid getting the shot.\\\\n\\\\nCOVID RESTRICTIONS: WHAT STATES HAVE EASED RULES FOLLOWING UPDATED CDC GUIDANCE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If we don\\'t present a unified message to those folks, it just reinforces that they don\\'t trust the vaccine.

Thursday\\\\u2019s reversal of policy was met with disdain by many mask proponents who claim to believe science should guide policymaking.\\\\n\\\\nMSNBC\\\\u2019s Rachel Madow admitted she would have to \\\\\"rewire\\\\\" herself to not view someone without a mask as a \\\\\"threat.\\\\\" And gun-control activist David Hogg tweeted he would continue wearing a mask even though he is fully vaccinated \\\\\"because the inconvenience of having to wear a mask is more than worth it to have people not think I\\\\u2019m a conservative.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRickett\\\\u2019s questioned the

(Hint: Skip that hard-boiled egg method for the first two days.)\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\\\u2019t remember bumping into any furniture and you certainly haven\\\\u2019t gone for cupping therapy or injections lately. But there it is: A purplish-blue patch on your arm or leg that has seemingly come out of nowhere. Should you be worried about that bruise?\\\\n\\\\nBruises are basically what happens when blood vessels burst just underneath one\\\\u2019s skin, which consists of three layers.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nWhile the outermost layer (epidermis) isn\\\\u2019t as easily damaged, the other two (dermis and subcutaneous tissues) are, explained Dr Adeline Yong, an associate consultant with National University Hospital\\'s Division of Dermatology.\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Freepik)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"When we develop a bruise, blood escapes from the ruptured capillaries and small veins, and spread into the surrounding tissue,\\\\\" she said. \\\\\"It is the capillaries of the subcutaneous tissues that make the greatest contribution to bruising.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Dr Edwin Chng, the medical director of Parkway Shenton, most bruises heal in one to two weeks\\\\u2019 time, although some may take longer than that. \\\\u201cThey start off red, then turn blue or purple. As they heal, bruises can turn green and yellow\\\\u201d.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nIt is the capillaries of the subcutaneous tissues that make the greatest contribution to bruising.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWHY YOU GET BRUISES \\\\u2013 AND WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR\\\\n\\\\nSo why do you get them when you think the furniture\\\\u2019s innocent?\\\\n\\\\nAge could be a factor that makes you bruise as easily as a tomato, said Dr Yong. Ageing could cause your skin and subcutaneous tissue to thin, and your capillaries to weaken \\\\u2013 all of which can increase your chances of bruising.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Pixabay/qimono)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you bruise \\\\\"spontaneously without trauma\\\\\", you should be concerned, cautioned Dr Yong, as it could be a sign of \\\\\"an underlying bleeding disorder\\\\\" that affects your blood platelet number and the way your blood coagulates.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough rare, such disorders include haemophilia; factor II, V, VII, X, or XII deficiencies; von Willebrand disease; connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers Danlos syndrome; endocrine disorders such as Cushing\\\\u2019s syndrome and hypothyroidism; and blood cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma, she said.\\\\n\\\\nTake note if five or more bruises occur simultaneously \\\\u2013 each bigger than 1cm in size \\\\u2013 and found not only on your limbs, but also your trunk and other areas, said Dr Yong. \\\\u200b\\\\u200b\\\\u200b\\\\u200b\\\\u200b\\\\u200b\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Pexels/Pixabay)\\\\n\\\\nSuch blue-black marks can also be caused by taking blood-thinning medication to prevent blood clots as well as deficiencies in protein and Vitamins C and K, said Dr Chng. To rule out concerns, see a doctor if your bruises are accompanied by these signs, he said:\\\\n\\\\nBruises developing for no reason\\\\n\\\\nBruises accompanied by fever\\\\n\\\\nDifficulty moving or walking because of the bruise\\\\n\\\\nSwelling of the joint caused by the bruise\\\\n\\\\nUnusual bleeding such as from the gums or in the urine\\\\n\\\\nAge could be a factor that makes you bruise as easily as a tomato.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWHEN IT\\\\u2019S NOT JUST A BRUISE BUT A HAEMATOMA\\\\n\\\\nSometimes, a bruise isn\\\\u2019t just a bruise, especially if you\\\\u2019ve had a major fall or injury such as a car accident. What can result is a haematoma, which is a swollen, raised and painful bump (bruises are usually flat), according to Cleveland Clinic\\\\u2019s website.\\\\n\\\\nHaematomas may require medical attention as the body may not heal them as easily as a minor injury, noted Medical News Today. \\\\u201cAs a result, a haematoma stays the same colour, firmness and causes the same level of pain even after several days.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nPain aside, another reason why you should let a doctor check your haematoma is because it could be a sign of injury to the internal organs if the bruise occurs with no known cause on the abdomen, head or trunk, according to Medical News Today. Get medical attention if your haematoma causes the following:\\\\n\\\\nNumbness in the arm or leg\\\\n\\\\nLoss of function of the joint, limb or muscle\\\\n\\\\nKeeps growing in size\\\\n\\\\nRecurs in the same spot or lasts longer than two weeks\\\\n\\\\nHappens alongside a broken bone\\\\n\\\\nOccurs on the head or neck\\\\n\\\\nCauses vision impairment\\\\n\\\\nWHAT CAN HEAL BRUISES FAST?\\\\n\\\\nSay you have a bruise despite your best effort to stay bump-free. What\\\\u2019s the best tip to help it heal fast?\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re thinking about rubbing a hard-boiled egg on it, Dr Yong pointed out that it \\\\u201chas not been shown to be effective in treating bruises.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nDr Chng agreed \\\\u2013 especially for the initial few days. \\\\\"In the first few days, rubbing a hard-boiled egg over a bruise may actually worsen it,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Freepik/valeria_aksakova)\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s because the heat from the egg encourages blood flow to the area, causing even more internal bleeding, he said. On the other hand, an ice pack or cold pad would slow down the flow of blood leaking out and pooling underneath your skin.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to use the egg method, massage the bruise only after 48 hours. \\\\\"This works because the egg holds heat, which can help to open up the blood vessels to disperse the red blood cells from the bruise,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nAs for arnica, a herb believed to treat bruises because of its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, Dr Yong said that \\\\\"studies have shown that it is no more effective than placebo in treating bruising, pain and swelling\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nWhat about hirudoid creams or gels? According to Dr Yong, they contain mucopolysaccharide polysulphate (MPS), which has been used for treating bruising, sports injuries and inflammation. \\\\\"Existing data suggests that it is unclear if it is efficacious in relieving bruising,\\\\\" she said.\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Pexels/Sora Shimazaki)\\\\n\\\\nAs for Vitamin K, which has been associated with helping blood to coagulate, Dr Yong is also not convinced that popping supplements would help your bruises to heal faster.\\\\n\\\\nApplying an ice pack and elevating the affected limb can \\\\\"reduce swelling and soothe pain\\\\\" but it is \\\\\"unclear if it helps in allowing bruises to heal faster\\\\\", she said.\\\\n\\\\nHOW AND WHEN TO ICE\\\\n\\\\nIf you are game to give cold therapy a go, consider putting a cold gel pack or a bag of ice on the bruise for 15 minutes every one to two hours, recommended Dr Chng. Repeat several times a day for a day or two as needed. \\\\u201cA thin towel should be used between your skin and the ice or other cold object,\\\\u201d he added.\\\\n\\\\nThe cold helps to slow down the flow of blood leaking out and pooling underneath your skin. On the other hand, a warm pack or heating pad would have the opposite effect as the heat encourages blood flow to the area.\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Pexels/Vidal Balielo Jr)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cRaising the bruised area above the level of the heart also helps to reduce swelling,\\\\u201d said Dr Chng. If you wish, you can also take paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce the pain and swelling, he added.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve been hit or punched in the face, apply an ice bag or cold gel pack as soon as possible to limit the swelling, recommended Healthline website. Hold the pack on the area for at least 10 minutes and no more than 30 minutes. Then, remove the pack for 15 minutes and repeat for about three hours.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"top_image\": \"https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/14753960/16x9/991/557/e3515a929d658bd1b33e6136bcdea8ba/sF/bruising-hero-freepik.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 17}, {'id': 1057185, 'source_link': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-the-big-read-frontline-healthcare-workers-14815630', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-16T23:10:43.294298Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-the-big-read-frontline-healthcare-workers-14815630\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"A common refrain among healthcare workers interviewed is that a big part of the psychological toll comes from not knowing what to expect when dealing with an unpredictable disease.\\\\n\\\\nSINGAPORE: It has been about eight months since Dr Wong Choo Wai ended his volunteer stint taking care of COVID-19 patients at Singapore Expo, but the 50-year-old sometimes wakes up in panic, thinking that he has overslept and is late for work.\\\\n\\\\nThe senior family physician is still reeling from his experience of working almost 24/7 from April to September last year - pulling 12-hour volunteering shifts at the community care facility, while also still running his two clinics and seeing his regular patients.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nGetting only three hours of sleep each day, Dr Wong said that there were days where he almost dozed off at work due to the mental and physical exhaustion.\\\\n\\\\nHe recalled one particular night in early May last year when he and other volunteers saw patients coming into the facility up until around 4am the next morning. Usually, new cases would stop coming in by midnight.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe next day, we were all so zonked out because each one of us saw at least a few hundred patients for that 12-hour shift,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI will say that I haven\\\\u2019t had a good break for a long time, and as much as I\\\\u2019m trying to go on every day without thinking too much about the past, I think I\\\\u2019m a bit burned out. And I think most of us (frontliners) are, but what to do?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nLike Dr Wong, many healthcare workers on the front line have been in overdrive for over a year fighting a pandemic which has infected over 160 million people and claimed more than 3 million lives globally.\\\\n\\\\nNot only are they working longer hours to contain the far-from-tamed outbreak, they also shoulder the mental stressors of being away from loved ones, getting infected or passing on the infection to those around them.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nThese fears became very real for a Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) nurse, who was among the healthcare workers there served with quarantine orders after a 46-year-old nurse tested positive for the infection last month.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe young nurse, who did not want to be identified as she was not authorised to speak to the media, recalled being in a state of disbelief when she got the call from the authorities informing her that she and her colleagues had to be quarantined.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI was just like, \\\\u2018No, it can\\\\u2019t be true lah.\\' I think I was still in shock,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\nEven though she was about to complete her quarantine in a few days when spoken to, the TTSH nurse said she felt apprehensive about what to expect at the hospital after she was released.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t know how it\\\\u2019s going to be like, how messy or calm the situation will be \\\\u2026 it\\\\u2019s not settled yet, it\\\\u2019s all play-by-ear. What if everything changes overnight and they have to implement something new to cope with the situation?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nIndeed, a common refrain among the healthcare workers interviewed is that a big part of the psychological toll comes from not knowing what to expect when dealing with an unpredictable disease.\\\\n\\\\nThe new wave of infections has also served as a cruel reminder that there is still no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\\n\\\\nMs Alice Ng, 59, who manages the 24-hour family clinic at Thomson Medical Centre, said: \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ve been a nurse for almost 33 years. I\\\\u2019ve been through SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1, and this is the toughest pandemic I\\\\u2019ve ever met.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a \\\\u201cchronic problem\\\\\" on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSERVING THE PUBLIC, SHUNNED BY THE PUBLIC\\\\n\\\\nAfter months of few community cases, the rising number of local infections in recent weeks - which has Singapore \\\\u201con the knife-edge\\\\u201d, as Education Minister Lawrence Wong put it - has also seen healthcare workers in several public hospitals coming down with the virus. This, in turn, has once again led to incidents of them being discriminated against by members of the public.\\\\n\\\\nSome healthcare workers have shared on social media their experiences of being shunned in public, with some having difficulties booking a taxi or private-hire ride, and others receiving wary looks or unkind comments from strangers.\\\\n\\\\nAssociate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Ministry of Health\\\\u2019s (MOH) director of medical services, said during a briefing held by the Government\\\\u2019s COVID-19 task force that some TTSH healthcare workers had been kicked out of their accommodation after the landlords learnt that they work at the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nThe healthcare workers spoken to also had experienced or heard of similar incidents of discrimination against their colleagues in recent weeks.\\\\n\\\\nOne doctor, who works at a public hospital, said she has not been able to have food delivered lately, as delivery riders have been rejecting orders coming from the hospitals. She declined to be named as she was not authorised to speak to the media.\\\\n\\\\nStaff nurse Afidah Aziz, 29, who works at the isolation ward at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, said she has gotten cold looks from taxi drivers after they found out that she works as a nurse at the hospital.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t wear my uniform when I go to work \\\\u2026 but (the drivers) will ask because they already know that I\\\\u2019m going to the hospital. They will ask, \\\\u2018What are you working as?\\\\u2019 Then whenever I say \\\\u2018nurse\\\\u2019, I will get them staring at me,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\nMs Jenny Sim Teck Meh, 70, chief nurse at Ren Ci Hospital - which is near TTSH - said a few of her nurses have reported that commuters steer clear of them on MRT trains.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s very disappointing to know that some people can behave like that, I don\\\\u2019t think that\\\\u2019s humane,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRen Ci chief nurse Jenny Sim Teck Meh (centre), 70, pictured with other frontline staff at the Ren Ci @ Bukit Batok St 52 nursing home on the first day of their vaccination exercise on Jan 11, 2021. (Photo: Ren Ci)\\\\n\\\\nPosting a screenshot showing drivers on ride-hailing app Grab cancelling rides to TTSH, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin said on Facebook earlier this week: \\\\u201cAll of us can support our folks at the frontlines. It\\\\u2019s the least we can do.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also voiced his concern, saying that it is \\\\u201cdistressing to see\\\\u201d the incidents of discrimination against TTSH staff members.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe cannot let setbacks divide us or wear us down, because if we lose our unity, the virus has won,\\\\u201d he wrote on Facebook on May 7.\\\\n\\\\nResponding to a question by Jurong Group Representation Constituency Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng on Tuesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament that the authorities have been working together with hospitals to provide support for the affected workers.\\\\n\\\\nThe Government is also working with hotel operators to provide alternative accommodation for healthcare workers who have been asked to move out by their landlords.\\\\n\\\\nMr Gan added: \\\\u201cWe want to urge Singaporeans to also show their support to these healthcare workers because they are putting themselves in harm\\\\u2019s way to protect us, so let us work together to protect them.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nIn response to these incidents, ride-hailing firm Gojek said it is working with TTSH to provide a S$10 voucher to all hospital employees.\\\\n\\\\nLien Choong Luen, the firm\\\\u2019s general manager, said Gojek is also stepping up education outreach efforts to its drivers to remind them that trips may include hospital pick-ups, and therefore, they should implement precautions to ensure a safe environment.\\\\n\\\\nMr Tan had updated his Facebook post with a response from Grab, which said that it had met with TTSH recently to see how it can support the hospital during this period.\\\\n\\\\nGrab added that it has started recruiting more volunteers for its GrabCare service, which provides round-the-clock rides home for healthcare workers at a lower commission rate.\\\\n\\\\nSACRIFICES WEIGH ON FAMILY\\\\n\\\\nFor healthcare workers who play dual roles of frontliner in the hospital and caregiver at home, the work does not end even after they have changed out of their scrubs.\\\\n\\\\nDr Brenda Mae Alferez Salada recalled how, during the circuit breaker from April to June last year, she would return home after a long day at work to help her son with his home-based learning.\\\\n\\\\nBut unlike other parents who played the role of teacher during that period, the 40-year-old resident physician at the National University Hospital\\\\u2019s (NUH) division of infectious diseases could only coach her son through FaceTime and video conferencing app Zoom, even though they were living under the same roof.\\\\n\\\\nThat was because Dr Salada and her husband, who works at TTSH, had chosen to isolate themselves from their son and helper in order to minimise the risk of spreading the infection to them.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the circuit breaker, Dr Brenda Salada (left) had to juggle working in the pandemic wards with coaching her son through his home-based learning. (Photo: National University Hospital)\\\\n\\\\nAt the time, a lot was still unknown about the nature of the disease. They did not want to take any risks since she and her husband worked in the pandemic wards and the emergency department respectively.\\\\n\\\\nThough they eventually reunited after a month when they were assured of the safety of hospital protocols and personal protective equipment (PPE), the family has recently been separated again because of the TTSH cluster.\\\\n\\\\nSince Dr Salada no longer works in the pandemic wards, the family thought it is safest for her husband to isolate himself at a hotel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cInitially my son was quite okay \\\\u2026 but once they announced that (my husband has to stay away) until the end of the month, then it sank in, and he didn\\\\u2019t want to go to school because he didn\\\\u2019t know when daddy would come back,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\nFor Dr Crystal Soh, the most challenging period was during last year\\\\u2019s circuit breaker when she and her husband, who is an emergency specialist at TTSH, had to juggle long and draining shifts at work with coming home to care for their children, who were then one and three years old.\\\\n\\\\nAs the couple did not want to put their elderly parents at risk of infection, they decided to stagger their work shifts so that either one of them could be with the children while the other was at work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe most difficult part was it was very intense. At work we were seeing very sick patients, being in the full set of PPE all day, then we had to quickly bathe, rush home, and then do the kiddie stuff - draw, read to them, do home-based learning with them,\\\\u201d Dr Soh said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt was really a full day of work until they slept,\\\\u201d added the 32-year-old associate consultant at NUH\\\\u2019s department of emergency medicine.\\\\n\\\\nMs Norashinta Mansoor, 39, a clinic assistant and trained nurse with Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, said the long hours mean that sometimes she would have to rush to the infant care centre to pick up her 13-month-old baby.\\\\n\\\\nShe has gotten used to the fact that Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays are busiest at the clinic, which is also a Public Health Preparedness Clinic that conducts swab tests. On those days, she would alert her 11-year-old daughter that she would have to be home alone for a while as Ms Norashinta finishes up at the clinic.\\\\n\\\\nMs Norashinta Mansoor, 39, a clinic assistant and trained nurse with Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, said the long hours mean that sometimes she would have to rush to the infant care centre to pick up her 13-month-old baby.

Because there just needs to be one slip somewhere, and it can have repercussions down the road, like a domino effect, and we don\\\\u2019t want that to happen.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nShe added that such incidents can take a toll on her because it leaves her constantly thinking what could have been done better to help patients and their families in the situation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDr Praseetha Nair, an associate consultant at the acute and emergency (A&E) department at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), said her department saw a constant flow of patients at the height of the pandemic. (Photo: KTPH)\\\\n\\\\nDr Jansen Koh, chief and senior consultant at Changi General Hospital\\\\u2019s (CGH) respiratory and critical care medicine, said there are times when he and his colleagues struggle to hold back their emotions while caring for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThey would not be able to have family members and friends at their bedside. Understandably, this makes the journey to recovery even harder for them. As healthcare workers, we try our best to be with them though we are all fully gowned up and have to minimise unnecessary contact,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\nFor the young TTSH nurse, the gravity of her situation finally sank in halfway into her quarantine, and she found herself breaking down after a video call with her colleagues who were also in isolation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe weren\\\\u2019t even talking about anything specifically about (the cluster) ... I don\\\\u2019t know why but that was when it dawned on me that, okay, this is really happening to me,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI think that was when the fear set in. I was thinking, \\\\u2018Oh no, what if I have (COVID-19)? What do I do next? What if I have to be hospitalised?\\\\u2019 I don\\\\u2019t think I can deal with being in the hospital on my own,\\\\u201d she added.\\\\n\\\\nShe had spent the days before trying to remain calm and staying strong for her family, but the isolation and psychological stress eventually became too much to handle on her own.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cBecause I see that (my family) is so scared, I cannot be scared ... even though I\\\\u2019m the one facing it,\\\\u201d said the nurse.\\\\n\\\\nAnother frontliner, Filipino staff nurse Princess Joyce Aguas, went through a tumultuous time when her family members, who live in Mexico, Pampanga, in the Philippines, contracted COVID-19 last month.\\\\n\\\\nHer father was in critical condition after contracting the disease and her family was in crisis mode going around to different hospitals trying to secure him a bed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt was 6am and I was sleeping when my sister called me and told me, \\\\u2018Papa wants to be rushed to the hospital right now,\\\\u2019\\\\u201d the 33-year-old nurse from Farrer Park Hospital said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI got so worried that I cried \\\\u2026 Over the phone I was telling them it\\\\u2019s going to be okay and to not be scared, but deep in my heart I knew it was bad.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMs Aguas, who has not seen her family since February last year, said she felt helpless at not being able to be there with them.\\\\n\\\\nShe had considered flying back then, but the next flight to the Philippines was a month away. That, combined with the lengthy quarantine period there and in Singapore, made it pointless to return home.\\\\n\\\\nSo she could only assist her family over video calls - giving instructions to her siblings and checking up on her father\\\\u2019s condition virtually. Her father has since stabilised.\\\\n\\\\nAsked how she managed her emotions while keeping up with the daily barrage of work, Ms Aguas said that although she sometimes could not stay focused, she tried to remain positive and left her personal problems behind when she tended to her patients.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt motivated me more that whatever care I wanted to give my family, I just gave it to the people who were in front of me. So that\\\\u2019s how I treated our patients here,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFilipino staff nurse Princess Joyce Aguas speaking to her father via a video call. When her family members, who live in Mexico, Pampanga, in the Philippines, contracted COVID-19 last month, all she could do was to assist virtually with advice.

It helped us that we were able to sound off each other and talk to each other.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, the young TTSH nurse said getting through quarantine has been made easier knowing that all her other colleagues are going through the same experience and rollercoaster of emotions.\\\\n\\\\nHer bosses also schedule twice daily Zoom calls to check in with everyone\\\\u2019s mental health. She also has video call sessions with her closer colleagues in the ward three times a day to keep each other company.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cUnfortunately, I would say it\\\\u2019s a lucky thing where most of us are quarantined so we do have people who are going through the same thing during this period,\\\\u201d she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cSometimes we will just video call to keep each other company, but we would all be doing our own thing.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nDr Soh said at the peak of the pandemic last year, her colleagues would offer to take over her shifts, or offer their days off if she needed more time with family. They also reassured her that it was okay to be late for work if her husband did not come back in time to take over with the kids.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor those who work in high-risk wards, the process of gowning up and spending a whole day in personal protective equipment (PPE) is physically draining, especially for someone like Dr Crystal Soh, who now has to do this while expecting her third child. (Photo: National University Hospital)\\\\n\\\\nDr Wong, the family physician, said his friends would offer to run errands for him. Some even offered to help him fight gym leaders on the mobile game Pokemon Go on his behalf, he quipped.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s good to know that people are holding your back when you need them to,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\nIn response to queries, the hospitals said they have introduced various initiatives to boost morale and take care of the mental well-being of their healthcare workers.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, TTSH has introduced a helpline and chatbot for staff who need counselling and emotional support.\\\\n\\\\nThe hospital is also working with MOH to provide staff who require alternative accommodation with a temporary place to stay. These are staff members who live with elderly parents, young children or immunocompromised individuals.\\\\n\\\\nA National University Health System (NUHS) spokesperson said it has offered free counselling sessions for staff members to provide them with emotional support.\\\\n\\\\nResilience workgroups have been formed to strengthen staff wellness and mental health. NUHS staff members have also been provided with meals and refreshments during this period.\\\\n\\\\nMr Stephen Chong, CGH\\\\u2019s chief human resource officer, said it has run virtual health and wellness programmes - such as yoga, piloxing, and qigong exercise classes - to help staff members keep fit and stay emotionally resilient.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cMeals were also provided to frontliners whose movements may be restricted for infection control purposes,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Sengkang General Hospital and KTPH have a dedicated peer support team which staff members can reach out to when they need a listening ear.\\\\n\\\\nSome healthcare workers have also pitched in with efforts to cheer up their peers and colleagues.\\\\n\\\\nOne of them is Ms Azrina Imran Tan, 26, an in-patient pharmacist at TTSH. She is part of the social committee in her department, where she looks after her colleagues\\' welfare.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the TTSH cluster broke out and her colleagues had to be quarantined, she and the other committee members reached out to those in isolation to check in on their well-being.\\\\n\\\\nOver the Mother\\'s Day weekend, they prepared care packages for the children whose mothers were in quarantine to explain to them why the women could not celebrate the day with them.\\\\n\\\\nMs Azrina recalled that one colleague cried after she received a card with messages from their other co-workers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cShe said that she\\\\u2019d been feeling quite down\\\\u2026 so when she received the card, she cried because she felt that even though she was physically alone, there were people looking out for her,\\\\u201d she said. \\\\u201cThat touched me quite a bit.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nPharmacist Azrina Imran Tan got involved with initiatives at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to bring cheer to her colleagues who were quarantined as a result of the hospital cluster. (Photo: TTSH)\\\\n\\\\nMs Sim, the Ren Ci chief nurse, said she would often buy breakfast and snacks for her nurses to give them an energy boost, especially since they cannot dine together during or outside of work.\\\\n\\\\nAside from their colleagues, the frontline healthcare workers said they also felt encouraged by the love shown to them by members of the public and their own patients.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, when the COVID-19 outbreak was at its worst last year, the hospitals received many care packages containing food, drinks and notes of encouragement.\\\\n\\\\nRemembering that period, Dr Nair said: \\\\u201cI think those gestures were far from small because it\\\\u2019s a reminder that you\\\\u2019re being looked out for and that there are people out there who appreciate what you\\\\u2019re doing.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nDr Wong said his patients, who knew that he had cut back his clinic hours to volunteer at the community care facility, also gave him food, goodies and words of encouragement when they came to see him at the clinic.\\\\n\\\\nSome of them would also plan their schedules around his by coming for their appointments earlier so that he could leave on time to make it for his volunteering shift.\\\\n\\\\nAt the community care facility, the migrant workers were also very appreciative, always expressing gratitude when they were being examined.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cIt makes us feel good \\\\u2026 at least we know that we are making a difference,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\nGEARING UP FOR WHAT\\\\u2019S NEXT\\\\n\\\\nLooking back on his experience, Dr Wong said he found it \\\\u201cquite incredulous\\\\u201d how he managed to survive those six months volunteering and running his two clinics in Bedok and Jurong.\\\\n\\\\nYet, he is now ready to head back to the frontline again.\\\\n\\\\nJust last week, he received a call from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) to help out at its emergency department.

But it does not have to be this way, says NUS Business School\\\\u2019s Dr Rashimah Rajah.\\\\n\\\\nSINGAPORE: Mother\\\\u2019s Day has just passed.\\\\n\\\\nFor most working mothers, it is an occasion for celebration, for how much they have achieved in taming the demands of both motherhood and their work ambitions.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nThose tensions are front and centre for many women in developed countries, because women are having babies later and focusing on their careers first.\\\\n\\\\nSingapore is no exception. The median age of first-time mothers is 30.3. More women are also giving birth in their 40s.\\\\n\\\\nThis means working women are essentially having babies at the same time their careers and salaries are taking off.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAt 35, a first-time mother will find herself juggling the caregiving duties for a baby as well as the increased workload and demands of a managerial job.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes both sets of responsibilities clash at the same time, when for example, work-from-home became the norm during circuit breaker and childcare centres had to shutter. It gets worse if there are a few young children to manage at home at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nCHECKING OUT\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nThis conflict between work and family begins at the start of motherhood. Many mums do not believe they can have \\\\u201cthe best of both worlds\\\\u201d and choose to drop out of the workforce.\\\\n\\\\nIndeed, between the ages of 25 to 29, both women and men participate equally in the labour force, with over 90 per cent participation rate, according to SingStat.\\\\n\\\\nThis number dips for women in their 30s and 40s, with a difference of about 5 percentage points between male and female labour force participation rates for workers in their 40s.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor those who stay, I have also heard anecdotes of female employees delaying the announcement of their pregnancies at work. They were worried of being overlooked for promotions and important projects prior to going on maternity leave.\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Unsplash/rawpixel)\\\\n\\\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Try Again This service is not intended for persons residing in the EU. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp\\'s partners.\\\\n\\\\nSome are also worried about being treated differently once they return to work, despite regulations and policies in place aimed to protect them from pregnancy-related discrimination.\\\\n\\\\nDIFFICULT RETURN TO WORK\\\\n\\\\nThe problem continues when mums return to work.\\\\n\\\\nAbout 35 per cent of employers in Asia saw less than 5 per cent of returning women being offered a more senior or even similar role in their company, compared to their roles before they left the workforce, according to a 2016 report by Robert Walters.\\\\n\\\\nWhen working mothers do return, they say they receive judgement from supervisors and colleagues when leaving early to fetch their children from daycare or when there is a child-related emergency.\\\\n\\\\nSome parents also say they tend to be afraid of being penalised in their performance if they took advantage of family-friendly policies offered.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes this stems from a sense of professional responsibility. I interviewed a senior manager of a multinational company who had her firstborn four months ago at the age of 34.\\\\n\\\\nShe, like some of her peers, returned to work three months \\\\u2013 not using up all of her maternity leave at one go \\\\u2013 as she had new members on her team and felt the need to settle important job-related matters.\\\\n\\\\nStill, although the situation in Singapore is not as severe compared to other countries \\\\u2013 I had an American ex-colleague who returned to work five days after childbirth \\\\u2013 we could do better in providing psychological safety to mothers.\\\\n\\\\nThey should have the peace of mind to truly take time off work while they sacrifice their time and sleep in taking care of our next generation.\\\\n\\\\nWoman speaking to a colleague in the office. (Photo: Unsplash/Mimi Thian)\\\\n\\\\nOf course, it is na\\\\u00efve to think this comes at no cost. Organisations do have to find alternative arrangements for the work to be done in the meantime, in having team members cover for the employee and hiring temporary staff.\\\\n\\\\nYet, when these measures are accepted, and become the modus operandi, managers can encourage mothers and those with caregiving duties to take time off and quit feeling like they owe the company something.\\\\n\\\\nIn Sweden, a country generous with maternity and paternity leave (480 days of paid parental leave per child, that parents share), mothers experience high levels of mental well-being.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a win-win solution. Research has also shown that paid maternity increases labour force participation and productivity, as women can return to their jobs where they have already developed skills.\\\\n\\\\nBENEFITS TO THE COMPANY, FATHERS\\\\n\\\\nThere are larger benefits for the company when stronger support for mums is rendered. Gender diversity has been shown to correlate with higher levels of organisational growth, innovation and productivity.\\\\n\\\\nAt a personal level, with the various challenges facing mothers managing work and home persisting, we are in danger of losing competent, high-performing members of the workforce.\\\\n\\\\nJust like how companies are prepared to pay top dollar for the best talent, providing a conducive environment to retain highly talented female employees is no different.\\\\n\\\\nRecognising that new mothers also mean new fathers is a first step. Fathers also play an active role in the upbringing and development of their children, and share the burden.\\\\n\\\\nOrganisations should exercise empathy to both genders \\\\u2013 encouraging this socially important function without worries related to career progression.\\\\n\\\\nGreen shoots are planting the way for us. There are measures giving paternity and shared parental leave in Singapore when a child is born.\\\\n\\\\nWFH arrangements for both parents in dual-income families have seen an increasing shift in men also taking responsibilities for childcare. Continuing in this direction can lighten the load on mothers.\\\\n\\\\nSAFE ENVIRONMENT AT HOME\\\\n\\\\nMore importantly, a safe environment must goes beyond paying lip service and having family-friendly policies in place.\\\\n\\\\nA mother feeding her baby at home. (Photo: Unsplash/Tanaphong Toochinda)\\\\n\\\\nMindsets are key. Offering subsidised or free childcare services and added childcare leave for parents may not be effective when employees fear judgement should they take up these offers.\\\\n\\\\nSimilar results regarding telecommuting policies pre-pandemic have been found, where the perceived importance of presenteeism discourages workers to work virtually.\\\\n\\\\nThis is especially so for parents of young children at the fastest growing part of their career. They have a lot to lose if they appear to be choosing family over their jobs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(Can you say no to returning to the office? Listen to EngageRocket CEO Leong Chee Tung and HR strategist Adrian Tan debate how to navigate this tricky dilemma on CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBEST OF BOTH WORLDS?\\\\n\\\\nFor organisations that can plan ahead, perhaps some degree of flexibility will help not only with new mums but all workers. Deliverables can still be finished by a certain deadline if working parents are given the autonomy to decide when and how they finish their work tasks.\\\\n\\\\nWell-planned meetings to discuss important issues can still be held before parents need to pick up their children from daycare.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes all it takes is a kind act \\\\u2013 like when colleagues offer a listening ear and show solidarity.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, fostering a collegial environment where co-workers are genuinely empathetic and where there is enough trust and transparency at the workplace to allow employees to reach greater heights in the multiple roles they hold at work and at home is what we should strive for.\\\\n\\\\nAfter celebrating Mother\\\\u2019s Day last week, let us work towards helping working mothers.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s consciously create a safe, supportive environment and let them know that it is, indeed, possible to have the best of both worlds.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDr Rashimah Rajah is a lecturer in the Department of Management & Organisation at National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

However, asking others for a password is not yet necessarily considered taboo.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps your colleague wants to use your computer and asks for your login. Or they may need access to a shared repository such as Dropbox but have forgotten the password.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re reluctant to share your personal password, or broadcast a team password in Slack or on a group chat, your instincts are correct. Passwords are deeply valuable pieces of information, and many catastrophic security breaches can be traced back to poor password management at work.\\\\n\\\\nBut if your colleague asks for a password, rather than responding with a short, sharp \\\\u201cno\\\\u201d, soften the blow by asking why they want it. If there is a legitimate reason, work with them to resolve the issue \\\\u2013 without giving anything away.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, instead of posting a Dropbox password on Slack, can you direct them to your organisation\\\\u2019s password manager and help them learn how to retrieve passwords from it? If it\\\\u2019s access to a computer they need, can you help them restart a computer and log in as a guest instead of as you?\\\\n\\\\n(Photo: Unsplash/Arif Riyanto)\\\\n\\\\nNever send usernames and passwords by email.\\\\n\\\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Many of us would be keen to help a friend by passing on their CV to the boss.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, malicious actors of all kinds also know this. As outlined in this article, fake CVs can be sent by email with a Microsoft Excel attachment.\\\\n\\\\nWhen opened, the attached file can launch malware that attempts to hijack private information, credentials from users of targeted financial institutions, and passwords and cookies stored in web browsers. Attackers can then exploit these acquisitions to make financial transactions.\\\\n\\\\nMalware is not just embedded in links and attachments \\\\u2013 even LinkedIn messages can contain malware. The consequences of opening such links or attachments can be extreme, and may even include ransomware (where hackers refuse access to files or online systems until the victim pays up).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t pass on CVs, especially if the person is a friend of a friend. Instead, pass on the person\\\\u2019s name to the boss, so she or he can look them up on LinkedIn.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t follow links sent to you, even by trusted contacts. Links can often be difficult to check without clicking on them and you may be redirected to a malicious site.\\\\n\\\\nAnd if you are the jobseeker, demonstrate your own cyber-security awareness by not circulating CVs or other documents with personal information that may be valuable to identity thieves. No birthdays or addresses \\\\u2013 just email, mobile number and LinkedIn.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe same rule applies to QR codes \\\\u2013 don\\\\u2019t blindly open the webpage pointed to on a business card QR code.

With SPACs as a listing structure, it has enabled companies, sponsors and other parties to cash in on the boom.\\\\n\\\\nOn the surface, SPACs offer a compelling story where expensive investment banks are cut out of the process, offering retail investors supposed rare opportunities to buy into high-growth tech start-ups \\\\u2013 the potential Amazons and Microsofts of tomorrow - right before the explosive growth phase sets in.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nHowever, while the rare chance to satisfy one\\\\u2019s robust appetite for high potential investments may seem attractive, not all is what it seems, and the good stories may not necessarily translate into compelling investments. Amid growing interest and enthusiasm in SPACs, the consideration of price and due diligence of the underlying risks may inadvertently take a backseat.\\\\n\\\\nWeWork SPAC\\\\n\\\\nRecent analysis has shown records of these cash shell structures delivering poor returns, with the majority falling below the standard price where their shares were first sold to the public.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a study by the Yale Journal on Regulation , completed SPAC mergers between January 2019 and June 2020, on average, have lost 12 per cent of their value within six months following the merger, despite the Nasdaq having risen by approximately 30 per cent during the same period.\\\\n\\\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Try Again This service is not intended for persons residing in the EU. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp\\'s partners.\\\\n\\\\nThe ostensibly poor investment record of SPACS is therefore a gripping reminder of the overall lack of transparency and disclosures in SPAC transactions which poses significant risks, especially to less experienced investors who may rush headlong into this without understanding these risks.\\\\n\\\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN SPONSORS AND THE EVERYDAY INVESTOR\\\\n\\\\nContrary to popular perception, SPACs are in fact very expensive for retail investors choosing to hold shares through the merger.\\\\n\\\\nThis is due to many reasons such as high sponsor fees, the amplification of underwriting fees and even warrant dilution, where the initial group of investors (typically hedge funds), exit during the pre-merger stage.\\\\n\\\\nThe same study by the Yale Journal on Regulation showed that the median effective underwriting fees for SPACs was approximately 16.3 per cent when the amplification effect is accounted for, compared to the median IPO underwriting costs of 7 per cent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen the sponsor\\\\u2019s promote and warrant dilution have been accounted for, the median total costs can add up to a staggering 50.4 per cent.\\\\n\\\\nThere is also a clear conflict of interest between sponsors and public investors. Sponsors tend to only partake in the upside potential but not the downside risk, which can result in a poor choice of SPAC targets.\\\\n\\\\nBecause SPAC sponsors receive essentially free shares and IPO investors get free warrants and rights, the returns to public investors are inevitably diluted.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial group of IPO investors who redeem their shares pre-merger are often able to earn an attractive and essentially risk-free return, while shareholders who remain invested through the merger tend to do poorly when post-merger shares decline in value.\\\\n\\\\nAn SGX sign is pictured at Singapore Exchange July 19, 2017. (File photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, given that SPACs must acquire and merge with an operating company within a limited timeframe of two years, sponsors are inherently incentivised to cut corners and close a sub-optimal deal, rather than risk having to return money to investors and be left with covering the pre-merger fee outlays from their own pockets.\\\\n\\\\nWhile advocates claimed that SPACs are a cheaper way to go public as compared to an IPO, this only holds true from the perspective of the target company but not secondary investors, to whom the costs are transferred. It seems increasingly apparent how the structure of SPAC companies stacks the deck against SPAC shareholders.\\\\n\\\\nNOT ALL BAD BUT SAFEGUARDS AND CAUTION REQUIRED\\\\n\\\\nIt is interesting that even though ESG investing has gained substantial traction in the past years, there remains a lack of care when it comes to basic accountability and transparency to investors in business practices.\\\\n\\\\nEthical business practices should continue to apply to everything that falls within the financial markets, rather than to serve a flavour-of-the-day marketing purpose.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately, Singapore\\\\u2019s local bourse, SGX, seems to share this view. SPAC rollout proposals for the SGX include measures such as a cap on dilution, restriction of only independent shareholders rather than sponsors being able to vote for a merger, as well as only allowing investors who vote against a merger to redeem their shares.\\\\n\\\\nAn SGX sign is pictured at Singapore Exchange July 19, 2017. (File photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)\\\\n\\\\nThese measures will go a long way in addressing the inherent problems such as the lack of transparency that are characteristic of typical US SPAC structures.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, challenges still remain and regulators have to continue ensuring that safeguards and disclosure requirements are in place so that SPAC investors have the necessary information to decide whether or not they should go ahead with the investment.\\\\n\\\\nIt should be pointed out that a few elements used in SPACs do have their upsides as well. For instance, the existing management team can benefit from the expertise of SPAC sponsors and the deep level of analysis that investors in a private investment round would typically undertake before committing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAn experienced sponsor team can also provide strategic and operational support, helping to fill gaps and broadening talent across the organisation.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, because a SPAC is essentially a \\\\u201creverse-takeover\\\\u201d vehicle, where the target company is not initially identified, investors looking to get in on the action will only have sponsors\\' credentials to base their investment decisions on.\\\\n\\\\nThis has meant an increasing number of high-profile investors, entrepreneurs, celebrities and even athletes assuming the role of sponsors, with the hopes of raising capital based solely on who they are and not what they are acquiring.\\\\n\\\\nThis can lead to difficult situations when even prominent venture capitalists such as Chamath Palihapitiya, Wall Street\\\\u2019s so-called king of SPACs, see their companies\\\\u2019 value plunge amid the frenzy.\\\\n\\\\nNonetheless, investors should be extremely careful about investing in any SPACs in their current structures, if not simply avoid them altogether. Even if the structural issues are resolved, hopefully with SGX\\\\u2019s amended proposals, further due diligence and consideration of risks remain highly important.\\\\n\\\\nDiversification across different sectors and styles (for example, balancing growth with value) and geographies for any investments, whether through SPACs, IPOs or equities generally, is critical in our view to enable sound risk management and achieve optimal risk adjusted long term return outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nMartin Hennecke is the Asia Investment Director at St. James\\\\u2019s Place Wealth Management.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nListen to Martin and Alvin Chow, CEO of financial education company Dr Wealth, speak on Money Mind\\'s 5 things you need to know about investing in SPACs:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\", \"top_image\": \"https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/14613814/16x9/991/557/ee5785aadbbe1c5668e08408e65d3be6/lj/grab-us-spac-merger-11222-jpg-1618310491.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 17}, {'id': 1057206, 'source_link': 'https://cnaluxury.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/the-glenlivet-single-cask-edition-15-year-old-scotch-whisky-14807978', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-16T23:10:43.294858Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://cnaluxury.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/the-glenlivet-single-cask-edition-15-year-old-scotch-whisky-14807978\", \"authors\": [\"Lin Weiwen\"], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"\", \"top_image\": \"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/14809100/16x9/768/432/77293c79657eaf1562875214f47b02f1/JI/hero-glenlivet-ed-support.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 17}, {'id': 1057428, 'source_link': 'https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1394075252238422017', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T00:12:24.361465Z', 'meta_json': '{\"id\": 1394075252238422017, \"id_str\": \"1394075252238422017\", \"conversation_id\": \"1393448499216150535\", \"datetime\": \"2021-05-16 23:40:15 UTC\", \"datestamp\": \"2021-05-16\", \"timestamp\": \"23:40:15\", \"user_id\": 25101704, \"user_id_str\": \"25101704\", \"username\": \"seattlepd\", \"name\": \"Seattle Police Dept.\", \"place\": \"\", \"timezone\": \"+0000\", \"mentions\": [], \"reply_to\": [], \"urls\": [\"https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2021/05/16/detectives-investigating-friday-saturday-night-shootings/\"], \"photos\": [], \"video\": 0, \"thumbnail\": \"\", \"tweet\": \"More details about this #RainierBeach shooting and Saturday\\\\u2019s shooting in #SouthLakeUnion here:  https://t.co/x4qcprrCkL\", \"lang\": \"en\", \"hashtags\": [\"rainierbeach\", \"southlakeunion\"], \"cashtags\": [], \"replies_count\": 1, \"retweets_count\": 2, \"likes_count\": 9, \"link\": \"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1394075252238422017\", \"retweet\": false, \"retweet_id\": \"\", \"retweet_date\": \"\", \"user_rt\": \"\", \"user_rt_id\": \"\", \"quote_url\": \"\", \"near\": \"\", \"geo\": \"\", \"source\": \"\", \"translate\": \"\", \"trans_src\": \"\", \"trans_dest\": \"\"}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 1}, {'id': 1058553, 'source_link': 'https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/bill-gates-marriage-to-melinda-report', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T00:13:36.741337Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/bill-gates-marriage-to-melinda-report\", \"authors\": [\"Bradford Betz\"], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"Long after marrying his now-estranged wife Melinda in 1994, Bill Gates reportedly \\\\\"pursued\\\\\" several women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\\\n\\\\nThe New York Times detailed at least two of those instances in a report Sunday.

Recently, US President Joe Biden announced the easing of mask policy for people who are fully vaccinated and termed it as \\'Great Day for America\\'. On May 4th he targeted vaccinating 70 percent of adults in the country by 4th July 2021.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, going by the current trend, people in India will have to wait for years before breathing freely without a mask.\\\\n\\\\nOn 16th January 2021, the Indian government started the so-called \\'biggest vaccination drive in the world\\' by first targeting 30 million front-line workers including health care professionals.\\\\n\\\\nThe drive was opened for people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities from 1st March 2021. Gradually the vaccination drive has been opened for everyone above the age of 18. However, there is a long way ahead for India to reach the 70% vaccination target of its estimated 900 million adults.\\\\n\\\\nFrom 9th to 15th May, 1.78 million vaccines have been administered daily on average.

So, by the time, 70% of the adults are vaccinated, more than half of them would need a new vaccine or a booster shot to fight the virus. This would mean shifting the target of 2 years from now further ahead.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, India\\'s vaccination policy needs a massive upgrade if the country wants to get ahead of the curve and plans a no mask life for its citizens in the future.\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/vaccine_pti_8-647x363.jpeg?dHbN5ThUjXqpO53tUILKmrWicitCci24\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1064014, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/how-india-s-second-covid-wave-is-denting-the-olympic-hopes-of-many-athletes-1803256-2021-05-16?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=readthis&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=readthis', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T01:23:09.906356Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/how-india-s-second-covid-wave-is-denting-the-olympic-hopes-of-many-athletes-1803256-2021-05-16?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=readthis&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=readthis\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-16 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"Rio silver medallist P.V.

Those plans are in limbo after the Badminton World Federation cancelled the tournaments due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. The shuttlers\\\\u2019 Olympic dreams now hang by a thread.\\\\n\\\\nComplicating matters for athletes is that with India accounting for nearly 40 per cent of global infections, many countries have imposed strict two-week quarantine for passengers from India. In some cases, countries have barred flights in their efforts to curb the spread. The women\\\\u2019s 4x100m and men\\\\u2019s 4x400m relay teams couldn\\\\u2019t compete in the World Athletics Relays on May 1 and 2 in Poland after its government put a ban on flights from India.

The remainder slots will now be filled on the basis of rankings where India falls short.\\\\n\\\\nALSO READ | Going to the Olympics is a dream come true: Indian sailor Nethra Kumanan\\\\n\\\\nThe Olympic aspirations of many athletes have been hurt because of India\\\\u2019s second wave of Covid infections. Years of training is negated if athletes aren\\\\u2019t able to compete and thereby maintain or improve their ranking to make it to the biggest sporting event in the world. Losing a spot in Olympics not because of failure but for not being able to travel to an event is even more frustrating for sportsmen and women. Lack of competition also hurts the preparation. Sports like boxing, badminton and wrestling are highly dependent on having adept practice partners during training.\\\\n\\\\nThankfully, at least one association has taken cognisance of the dire situation and managed to make arrangements for its Olympic-bound athletes. The 15-member Indian shooting contingent is in Croatia where, after a week of quarantine, it will begin training and then compete in two tournaments. It will leave for Tokyo in July from Zagreb itself.\\\\n\\\\nBut with Japan itself dealing with a surge in cases and having several areas, including Tokyo, under a state of emergency, the country\\'s government is facing heat from its citizens to once again postpone the event. In a recent survey held in Japan, 60 per cent of respondents said they\\\\u2019d like the Games to be cancelled, and a letter from a union of the country\\\\u2019s doctors said it was \\\\u201cimpossible to hold a safe and secure Olympics during the pandemic\\\\u201d. After delaying the Games by a year, if the pandemic shows no signs of abating this time around, Japan may have to cancel the event altogether. With that at least 10,000 athletes from across the globe will have to hope that they are competitive until 2024.\\\\n\\\\nRead India Today magazine by downloading the latest issue: https://www.indiatoday.com/emag\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/Sports-Olympics-647x363.jpeg?J1LDd72zPoh2qjCLL8hyZaw6m5D3T5GS\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1064015, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/in-a-graphic-states-under-lockdown-1803266-2021-05-16?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=readthis&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=readthis', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T01:23:09.906381Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/in-a-graphic-states-under-lockdown-1803266-2021-05-16?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=readthis&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=readthis\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-16 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"State governments have imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19\\\\n\\\\nadvertisement\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/WhatsApp_Image_2021-05-16_at_8-647x363.jpeg?C3o5jYaeVg2oa1qQ3zCFQX1Munl_JwIH\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1064016, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/video/patient-viral-love-you-zindagi-loses-battle-covid-1802962-2021-05-15?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=watchrightnow&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=watchrightnow', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T01:23:09.906405Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/video/patient-viral-love-you-zindagi-loses-battle-covid-1802962-2021-05-15?utm_source=rhs&utm_medium=It&utm_campaign=watchrightnow&t_source=rhs&t_medium=It&t_campaign=watchrightnow\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-15 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"In a video that went viral on social media earlier this week, 30-year-old Shruti swayed to the song \\'Love You Zindagi\\' from Bollywood film \\'Dear Zindagi\\' as she battled Covid-19 and waited for a bed in a hospital\\'s emergency ward.\\\\n\\\\nShe was later shifted to the intensive care unit.

Their client is seeking punitive and compensatory damages including the more than $15 million in equity he claims he lost with his unfair ouster.\\\\n\\\\nTOSHIBA GETS TAKEOVER BID FROM PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM CVC\\\\n\\\\nIn late February, a state appeals court denied buyout firm LLR\\\\u2019s request to stop a Los Angeles court from scheduling a trial, setting the stage for a May 2022 trial in California \\\\u2014 a state with a reputation as a plaintiff\\\\u2019s paradise where civil juries routinely dole out huge verdicts against big business. On May 5, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kevin Brazile dismissed LLR\\\\u2019s motion to delay the trial until Delaware ruled on the matter, according to court papers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There is insufficient basis for the court to conclude West will have an adequate jury trial in Delaware at this time,\\\\\" the judge ruled.\\\\n\\\\nLegal insiders say buyout firms coast to coast are anxiously waiting to see what happens. Judge Cowan\\\\u2019s decision in the West case \\\\\"add[s] uncertainty as to whether Delaware entities can rely on the Court of Chancery being their forum of choice,\\\\\" attorneys at white-shoe law firm Ropes & Gray, who aren\\\\u2019t directly involved, wrote in a memo last fall.\\\\n\\\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\\\\n\\\\nIn the Ceva case, plaintiffs allege that executives at Apollo strongly encouraged management at Ceva\\\\u2019s predecessor company, the Jacksonville, Fla.-based trucking giant TNT Logistics, to invest in the 2007 deal. Apollo also eventually bought some of the loans TNT took to finance the buyout, and when the renamed Ceva Logistics in 2013 filed for bankruptcy, Apollo arranged a debt-for-equity exchange that left it in control of Ceva, court papers allege.\\\\n\\\\nMcEvoy claims he has found documents through discovery that show those holding equity stakes in the company were not treated equally. Specifically, he claims Ceva execs who stayed with the company got to keep some of their equity after the bankruptcy, while others like him lost all their money. Apollo, now helmed by CEO Marc Rowan, last year got some of the suit dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We believe this case has no merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against it,\\\\\" an Apollo spokeswoman said.\\\\n\\\\nIn West\\\\u2019s dispute, he alleges that his company ACRE was a fast-growing business when LLR took control of it in 2013, with clients including Rockefeller Center and Prudential. But two years later, it was the lone bright spot in LLR\\\\u2019s investment fund, according to court papers, and the buyout firm allegedly pushed to extract cash from ACRE through a so-called \\\\\"dividend recap.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWest and one of his co-founders expressed concern the move would cripple ACRE\\\\u2019s finances. When they instead offered to buy the company back, LLR allegedly fired West, accusing him of disclosing confidential financial data \\\\u2014 a claim West calls \\\\\"preposterous.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\\\\n\\\\nLLR in March sold ACRE to the Triton Funds.

Those plans are in limbo after the Badminton World Federation cancelled the tournaments due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. The shuttlers\\\\u2019 Olympic dreams now hang by a thread.\\\\n\\\\nComplicating matters for athletes is that with India accounting for nearly 40 per cent of global infections, many countries have imposed strict two-week quarantine for passengers from India. In some cases, countries have barred flights in their efforts to curb the spread. The women\\\\u2019s 4x100m and men\\\\u2019s 4x400m relay teams couldn\\\\u2019t compete in the World Athletics Relays on May 1 and 2 in Poland after its government put a ban on flights from India. Only the top 16 teams, as of July 1, can qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. It was a similar story for the canoeing team, which missed out on the Asian Canoe Slalom Championships and the Asian Canoe Sprint Championships in Pattaya\\\\u2014their last shot at qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics\\\\u2014after the Thailand government enforced a travel ban on visitors from India in mid-April.\\\\n\\\\nIndia\\\\u2019s hopes of increasing its boxing representation in Tokyo was also hurt after a world qualifying tournament to be held in Paris in June was cancelled.

The remainder slots will now be filled on the basis of rankings where India falls short.\\\\n\\\\nALSO READ | Going to the Olympics is a dream come true: Indian sailor Nethra Kumanan\\\\n\\\\nThe Olympic aspirations of many athletes have been hurt because of India\\\\u2019s second wave of Covid infections. Years of training is negated if athletes aren\\\\u2019t able to compete and thereby maintain or improve their ranking to make it to the biggest sporting event in the world. Losing a spot in Olympics not because of failure but for not being able to travel to an event is even more frustrating for sportsmen and women. Lack of competition also hurts the preparation. Sports like boxing, badminton and wrestling are highly dependent on having adept practice partners during training.\\\\n\\\\nThankfully, at least one association has taken cognisance of the dire situation and managed to make arrangements for its Olympic-bound athletes. The 15-member Indian shooting contingent is in Croatia where, after a week of quarantine, it will begin training and then compete in two tournaments. It will leave for Tokyo in July from Zagreb itself.\\\\n\\\\nBut with Japan itself dealing with a surge in cases and having several areas, including Tokyo, under a state of emergency, the country\\'s government is facing heat from its citizens to once again postpone the event. In a recent survey held in Japan, 60 per cent of respondents said they\\\\u2019d like the Games to be cancelled, and a letter from a union of the country\\\\u2019s doctors said it was \\\\u201cimpossible to hold a safe and secure Olympics during the pandemic\\\\u201d. After delaying the Games by a year, if the pandemic shows no signs of abating this time around, Japan may have to cancel the event altogether. With that at least 10,000 athletes from across the globe will have to hope that they are competitive until 2024.\\\\n\\\\nRead India Today magazine by downloading the latest issue: https://www.indiatoday.com/emag\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/Sports-Olympics-647x363.jpeg?J1LDd72zPoh2qjCLL8hyZaw6m5D3T5GS\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1069400, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/mumbai/story/pil-in-bombay-high-court-seeks-dedicated-vaccine-anointment-booking-portal-for-mumbai-1803322-2021-05-17', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T02:31:56.620156Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/mumbai/story/pil-in-bombay-high-court-seeks-dedicated-vaccine-anointment-booking-portal-for-mumbai-1803322-2021-05-17\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-17 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"The Bombay High Court has filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the court\\'s intervention in the issues concerning the booking of vaccination slots on the CoWin vaccination portal.\\\\n\\\\nYogeeta R Vanzara, a schoolteacher in Mumbai, filed the plea seeking a dedicated portal and booking mechanism for Mumbai.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cVarious centres show availability of seats at midnight or thereafter and yet booked within seconds of the same being offered to the public,\\\\u201d the petition stated.\\\\n\\\\nVanzara also mentioned in the petition that the CoWin portal seems to suggest vaccine availability at various hospitals for which citizens are given appointments.

It\\'s worked out well for the company \\\\u2014 so far. But it\\'s starting to look like the king of streaming will soon need something other than new subscribers to keep growing.\\\\n\\\\nThe streaming service reported Tuesday it now has 208 million subscribers globally , after adding 4 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2021. But that number missed expectations and the forecasts for its next quarter were also pretty weak.\\\\n\\\\nThat was a big whiff for Netflix \\\\u2014 a company coming off a massive year of growth thanks in large part to the pandemic driving people indoors \\\\u2014 and Wall Street\\'s reaction has not been great.\\\\n\\\\nThe company\\'s stock dropped as much as 8% on Wednesday, leading some to wonder what the future of the streamer looks like if competition continues to gain strength, people start heading outdoors and if, most importantly, its growth slows.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If you hit a wall with [subscriptions] then you pretty much don\\'t have a super growth strategy anymore in your most developed markets,\\\\\" Michael Nathanson, a media analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson, told CNN Business. \\\\\"What can they do to take even more revenue out of the market, above and beyond streaming revenues?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOr put another way, the company\\'s lackluster user growth last quarter is a signal that it wouldn\\'t hurt if Netflix \\\\u2014 a company that\\'s lived and died with its subscriber numbers \\\\u2014 started thinking about other ways to make money.\\\\n\\\\nAn ad-supported Netflix? Not so fast\\\\n\\\\nThere are ways for Netflix to make money other than raising prices or adding subscribers. The most obvious: selling advertising.\\\\n\\\\nNetflix could have 30-second commercials on their programming or get sponsors for their biggest series and films. TV has worked that way forever, why not Netflix?\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s probably not going to happen, given that CEO Reed Hastings has been vocal about the unlikelihood of an ad-supported Netflix service. His reasoning: It doesn\\'t make business sense.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It\\'s a judgment call... It\\'s a belief we can build a better business, a more valuable business [without advertising],\\\\\" Hastings told Variety in September. \\\\\"You know, advertising looks easy until you get in it. Then you realize you have to rip that revenue away from other places because the total ad market isn\\'t growing, and in fact right now it\\'s shrinking. It\\'s hand-to-hand combat to get people to spend less on, you know, ABC and to spend more on Netflix.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHastings added that \\\\\"there\\'s much more growth in the consumer market than there is in advertising, which is pretty flat.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHe\\'s also expressed doubts about Netflix getting into live sports or news, which could boost the service\\'s allure to subscribers, so that\\'s likely out, too, at least for now.\\\\n\\\\nSo if Netflix is looking for other forms of near-term revenue to help support its hefty content budget ($17 billion in 2021 alone) then what can it do? There is one place that could be a revenue driver for Netflix, but if you\\'re borrowing your mother\\'s account you won\\'t like it.\\\\n\\\\nNetflix could crack down on password sharing \\\\u2014 a move that the company has been considering lately.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Basically you\\'re going to clean up some subscribers that are free riders,\\\\\" Nathanson said. \\\\\"That\\'s going to help them get to a higher level of penetration, definitely, but not in long-term.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLackluster growth is still growth\\\\n\\\\nMissing projections is never good, but it\\'s hardly the end of the world for Netflix. The company remains the market leader and most competitors are still far from taking the company on. And while Netflix\\'s first-quarter subscriber growth wasn\\'t great, and its forecasts for the next quarter alarmed investors, it was just one quarter.\\\\n\\\\nNetflix has had subscriber misses before and it\\'s still the most dominant name in all of streaming, and even lackluster growth is still growth. It\\'s not as if people are canceling Netflix in droves.\\\\n\\\\nAsked about Netflix\\'s \\\\\"second act\\\\\" during the company\\'s post-earnings call on Tuesday, Hastings again placed the company\\'s focus on pleasing subscribers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We do want to expand. We used to do that thing shipping DVDs, and luckily we didn\\'t get stuck with that. We didn\\'t define that as the main thing. We define entertainment as the main thing,\\\\\" Hastings said.\\\\n\\\\nHe added that he doesn\\'t think Netflix will have a second act in the way Amazon has had with Amazon shopping and Amazon Web Services. Rather, Netflix will continue to improve and grow on what it already does best.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I\\'ll bet we end with one hopefully gigantic, hopefully defensible profit pool, and continue to improve the service for our members,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"I wouldn\\'t look for any large secondary pool of profits.

Specifically, there were no Black characters or directors with whom she felt a connection.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I didn\\'t see my father, my brother, my husband represented,\\\\\" Spencer told CNN Business. \\\\\"The media was really inundated with these false stereotypes.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnd so began Spencer\\'s hunt for a service with relatable Black content. After all, she assumed, there had to be one. For Spencer, it was also personal. At the time, she had just finished her first documentary, \\\\\"Mom Interrupted,\\\\\" which chronicled the loss of children from gun violence through the lens of seven mothers in the Washington DC area. It played at the Alexandria Film Festival.\\\\n\\\\nShe was the only Black person there, she said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I really started to see the disparity for people of color \\\\u2014 and especially women of color \\\\u2014 when it came to getting distribution,\\\\\" Spencer said. \\\\\"And so when I couldn\\'t find what I was looking for, a light bulb went off. I\\'ll start a streaming service.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLaunching a streaming service in an already crowded market is difficult enough. What Spencer didn\\'t know at the time was just how hard it is for Black women to secure funding from venture capital firms \\\\u2014 a struggle that highlights the gap marginalized founders face when it comes to access.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It\\'s not about just the water hoses\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nlaunched In 2015, Spencerlaunched kweliTV , a carefully curated collection of more than 500 streaming options that are, as the company puts it, \\\\\"a true reflection of the global Black experience versus what we may sometimes see in mainstream media.\\\\\" Almost a year after George Floyd\\'s death sparked global protests and reignited conversations about systemic racism, kweliTV\\'s mission -\\\\u2014 kweli meaning \\\\\"truth\\\\\" in Swahili \\\\u2014 is finding itself in an increasingly prominent position to fill a void that some dominant streaming companies have been criticized for ignoring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"White people need to be educated,\\\\\" Spencer said, noting that mainstream platforms might stream \\\\\"The Help\\\\\" and \\\\\"Green Book\\\\\" among other films about Black experiences, but have been criticized for being clich\\\\u00e9. \\\\\"[Black people] already know that history, and we don\\'t necessarily need to see it over and over again.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDocumentaries like \\\\\" Negroes With Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power ,\\\\\" which streams on kweliTV, is just one example that illustrates how the platform better represents the Black diaspora\\'s experience, according to Spencer. The documentary profiles Rob Williams, a Black freedom fighter, who advocated for the Second Amendment as a means for Black people to defend themselves against violent, White mobs in the Jim Crow South.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This was a figure I had never heard of before,\\\\\" Spencer said. \\\\\"Again, this is about racism, but it\\'s really about fighting back. It\\'s not about just the water hoses.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA still from the film \\\\\"Negroes With Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power\\\\\". Available on Kweli.TV, it profiles Rob Williams, a Black freedom fighter, who advocated for the Second Amendment as a means for Black people to defend themselves against violent, White mobs in the Jim Crow South.\\\\n\\\\nThe biggest challenge: funding\\\\n\\\\nWhile kweliTV continues to make progress, it still has a long way to go relative to its competition. Netflix reported it will spend more than $17 billion on original content in 2021 alone. In comparison, kweliTV has no original content to date. In its little under six years of existence, the company has relied on its own revenue, a handful of grants, two convertible notes, and a PPP loan that was used for payroll, according to Spencer.\\\\n\\\\nThe lack of funding is not on account of a lack of effort. Spencer said she learned quickly how hard it is for Black women to secure funding. And the numbers corroborate those struggles. Black women-founded companies raised $700 million between 2018 and 2019. While that\\'s a significant increase from years prior, it\\'s still just 0.27% of the total VC investments during that time, according to research from digitalundivided , a nonprofit that promotes Black and Latinx women entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It\\'s ridiculous that Black women don\\'t even get half of one percent,\\\\\" Spencer said in response to that study.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem with VC funding stems largely from a lack of diversity, according to Ivan Alo and LaDante McMillon, who founded New Age Capital , a seed stage VC firm focused on tech startups founded by Black and Latinx entrepreneurs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The venture capital industry -- it has invested a certain type of way for a very long time, and they\\'ve been making billions and billions of dollars,\\\\\" McMillon told CNN Business. \\\\\"So they have no incentive to actually start looking at any new demographics.\\\\\" The lack of diversity within the VC industry itself also perpetuates that, according to McMillon. \\\\\"What starts to happen is a trickle down effect of no money actually going to a Black woman founder or Latina founder or a Black man or a Latino.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe killing of George Floyd and global pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement challenged the VC industry, among others, by exposing the racial biases the Black community faces. Both McMillon and Alo noted that there\\'s still a lot of work to be done.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I think there was a lot of diversity theater last year, a lot of people virtue signaling,\\\\\" McMillon said. \\\\\"Do I believe that it substantially changed the tide? Probably not. But I do think it\\'s opened up just the aperture a bit about what could potentially be coming from these communities.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDespite vows to diversify portfolios, Spencer said funding still remains her toughest challenge.\\\\n\\\\nShe did receive money from Voqal, a coalition of nonprofits based in Boulder, Colorado, where she participated in a fellowship program in 2017. \\\\\"Systemic problems take systemic solutions,\\\\\" Mary Coleman, Community Program Leader at Voqal, told CNN Business. \\\\\"We really saw her on the forefront of leading this work and it\\'s come to fruition,\\\\\" Coleman said. \\\\\"Not only with the stories that are being told, but also the way that revenue is being generated and distributed.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDeShuna Spencer is the founder and CEO of Kweli.TV.\\\\n\\\\nMore than just a streaming service\\\\n\\\\nWhile powerhouses like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ can afford to create and buy content, kweliTV\\'s lack of funding has forced it to take a different approach.\\\\n\\\\nEvery quarter, kweliTV pays out 60% of its revenue to filmmakers on its platform. Each filmmaker\\'s pay is relative to their film\\'s performance. \\\\\"We promote them all the same, and that is very different from a lot of the other platforms,\\\\\" Spencer said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"When I found out about all the difficulties, I had to make a decision. Do I say, \\'OK, I guess this is what it is: streaming services are too hard. You need a lot of money to do it, and maybe I just need to find another dream.\\' Or do I figure out how do I make my dream reality whether anyone writes me a check, and I decided to focus on how to make this happen.\\\\\" Spencer said. \\\\\"That\\'s where the 60% revenue share came in.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWhen people hear \\\\\"streaming service\\\\\" and \\\\\"Black content\\\\\" together, there are obvious parallels to the giants of the industry. Indeed, some have called kweliTV the \\\\\"Black Netflix,\\\\\" but Spencer disagrees with that comparison. The byproduct of its revenue sharing strategy doesn\\'t just lower the bar for entry, it also fosters a community that Spencer hopes makes kweliTV much more than just a streaming service.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"About 90% of our filmmakers I have spoken to personally,\\\\\" Spencer said. \\\\\"It\\'s not a transactional type of thing where we have your film and that\\'s it. We want people to be a part of this ecosystem.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRanking among giants\\\\n\\\\nSpencer\\'s patient demeanor and calm voice mask her underlying fiery work ethic. The founder is aided by a few part-time employees. As for full-timers, she\\'s been the only one for years,\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I work 16, 18 hour days,\\\\\" she said.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately for Spencer, a recent $100,000 investment will allow the company to hire an additional full-time employee to help out.\\\\n\\\\nThose long days appear to be paying off for the company. Spencer says the company\\'s registered users jumped to around 43,000 as of May 2021, which includes non-paying users who stream the free, ad-supported kweliTV Live service. That surge marked a 111% growth in users year-over-year. Paying subscribers have the option of paying $5.99 per month or $49.99 annually. Spencer declined to comment on the number of paying subscribers and the company\\'s revenue.\\\\n\\\\nThe company has also brought on Lil Rel Howery, a comedian known for his roles in \\\\\"Get Out,\\\\\" \\\\\"Bad Trip,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Uncle Drew,\\\\\" as its head of comedy. \\\\\"It\\'s an added bonus to our mission of amplifying authentic, global Black stories and storytellers of African descent,\\\\\" Spencer said in an email about Howery\\'s role.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in classic David vs. Goliath fashion, kweliTV now stands among giants. It ranked second behind only Netflix in PC Magazine\\'s 2021 review of the best streaming platforms for Black content.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"To me it shows that there is room for this type of content that we are curating,\\\\\" Spencer said while reflecting on the company\\'s ranking. \\\\\"We have a better pulse on what the Black community is yearning for.\\\\\"\", \"top_image\": \"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210505162431-kweli-tv-screen-super-tease.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 2}, {'id': 1074639, 'source_link': 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506000001/', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T03:41:54.570312Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506000001/\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"\", \"top_image\": \"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/4d5e3c7d-5770-427e-95de-7421c33355f1/d7286a42-06b6-46f3-8f4c-03740e18dadd/1280x720/match/image.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 7}, {'id': 1074641, 'source_link': 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506265001/', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T03:41:54.570363Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506265001/\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"\", \"top_image\": \"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/584ef7bf-77e5-4b4f-b838-3b0026a8e602/5443fcb6-44bc-47dc-992b-32e10455a7c1/1280x720/match/image.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 7}, {'id': 1074642, 'source_link': 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506424001/', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T03:41:54.570388Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6254506424001/\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"None\", \"text\": \"\", \"top_image\": \"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c609668a-79a4-43f7-8c9a-5bd1c28d03ad/538af878-c114-4f98-8622-52cc9a01912d/1280x720/match/image.jpg\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 7}, {'id': 1074737, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/breaking-news-live-updates-coronavirus-israel-palestine-vaccine-shortage-cyclone-tauktae-1803327-2021-05-17', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T03:42:22.726624Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/breaking-news-live-updates-coronavirus-israel-palestine-vaccine-shortage-cyclone-tauktae-1803327-2021-05-17\", \"authors\": [\"Posted Shreya Sinha\"], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-17 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"Israel stages new round of heavy airstrikes on Gaza City\\\\n\\\\nIsraeli warplanes unleashed a series of heavy airstrikes at several locations of Gaza City early Monday, hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war with Gaza\\'s Hamas rulers would rage on.\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/breaking_news/202105/newsflashfin-647x363.jpeg?Lo3hPZL2DmsGiyxDlWQR_q1s6f.m_yTu\", \"movies\": []}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1074738, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cyclone-tauktae-in-india-tracking-goa-path-heavy-rains-deaths-mumbai-kerala-maharashtra-gujarat-storm-news-live-updates-1803330-2021-05-17', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T03:42:22.726674Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cyclone-tauktae-in-india-tracking-goa-path-heavy-rains-deaths-mumbai-kerala-maharashtra-gujarat-storm-news-live-updates-1803330-2021-05-17\", \"authors\": [\"Posted Chanchal Chauhan\"], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-17 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"6 dead, houses damaged, electricity poles uprooted, people evacuated as Cyclone Tauktae hurtled towards Gujarat\\\\n\\\\nCyclone Tauktae LIVE Tracking Updates: Gale-force winds, heavy rainfall and high tidal waves swept the coastal belt of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa as Cyclone Tauktae hurtled northwards towards Gujarat on Sunday, leaving six people dead, damaging hundreds of houses, uprooting electricity poles and trees and forcing evacuation in low-lying areas.

From around 11,000 cases of new infections daily, it skyrocketed to over a lakh, rapidly doubling every week till by April end and early May, the numbers infected crossed 400,000 daily. It was a world record in daily cases for a single country, the highest such figure since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. When Mukherjee warned India of the coming wave, the country had 11 million active cases of Covid infection. In just two months that figure more than doubled and stood at 23.3 million on May 12. Among those infected was Mukherjee\\\\u2019s father who finally took his first dose of the vaccine only in mid-April and is now recovering from the disease. India is second only to the US in terms of number of infections caused by Covid-19. The death toll has gone up from an average of 1,000 daily in the first wave to a numbing 4,000 daily\\\\u2014and still counting. The big question on everyone\\\\u2019s mind: when will the nightmare end?\\\\n\\\\nWHEN WILL THE WAVE PEAK?\\\\n\\\\nTo answer this question, it is important for the central government to get a good estimate of when the wave will peak and the factors that could cause its decline so as to put a strategy in place to halt the pandemic. Research models that make projections based on certain statistical criteria and assumptions are of great help. In mid-April, Mukherjee and a group of researchers at the University of Michigan, who have set up a special model to track the progress of Covid-19 in India, projected that the second wave could peak by mid-May at an alarming 800,000 to 1 million new cases daily and 4,500 deaths by May-end.\\\\n\\\\nMukherjee still stands by her prediction that India would turn the corner by mid-May though new cases in India, averaging around 350,000 a day currently, have not hit the levels her team had projected. She admits the height of the peak is debatable since \\\\u201cthe model rests on the edifice of new case countsbut because of the bottlenecks in testing in India there are a large number of undetected infections happening which makes the actual figure of the infected nebulous.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Washington University, which maintains a database of worldwide statistical reports of Covid-19, also predicted a mid-May peak for India. It projected that, in the worst case scenario, by August 2021 India would record a devastating 1.04 million deaths. But if the country followed a universal masking policy, IHME predicted the mortality numbers would drop by 250,000 to around 880,000. This is still frighteningly high, given that the current death toll stood at 254,000, as of May 10. (The IHME estimates that actual Covid related deaths in India are double the official figure.)\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, two groups of Indian data modellers, who also maintain that mid-May will see a peak in infections, are more circumspect in their projections of infected cases and deaths. One of them is the Sutra Group consisting of M. Vidyasagar, distinguished professor, IIT Hyderabad, Manindra Agarwal, professor of computer science and engineering, IIT Kanpur and Lt Gen. Madhuri Kanitkar, deputy chief of Integrated Defence Staff (Medical). The group has been tasked by the department of science and technology (DST) to work out a \\\\u2018supermodel\\\\u2019 to predict the progression of the pandemic. In early April, the Sutra Group first projected that the second wave would peak at around 120,000 cases daily by April end. But by mid-April as the cases grew relentlessly, the group reworked its numbers and said that the second wave would peak at a moving average of 400,000 cases between May 8 and 15. Vidyasagar says their simulation model is robust because it is built around several key parameters including rate of infections, mobility of people, virus variants, recovery rate, geographic spread and the ratio of detected cases to undetected ones.\\\\n\\\\nOther modelling experts like Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, however, criticise the DST supermodel for constantly \\\\u201cshifting the goal posts\\\\u201d and call it a \\\\u201cstupid model\\\\u201d. (The DST itself has admitted that the Sutra model had underestimated the impact of the second wave.) Menon points out one of the big issues in getting authentic data to make calculations: \\\\u201cIn India, for every positive case that is revealed through testing, there are 20 others who have not been tested. Mortality figures are usually completely forged and many Covid deaths are not registered. Any model is only as good as the data you feed it.\\\\u201d The model that Menon developed along with a consortium of scientists, called INDSCI-SIM (Indian Scientists\\\\u2019 Response to Covid-19), factored in these inconsistencies and projects that the second wave would peak in mid-May at around 500,000 to 600,000 cases daily.\\\\n\\\\nWHERE WILL IT SPREAD?\\\\n\\\\nThe real worry, though, is that the pandemic that first struck on the west coast of India and has now moved to the east and south shows no signs of abating. Health ministry statistics reveal that 26 of the 28 states in the country have a positivity rate of 15 per cent and above\\\\u2014much higher than the positivity rate of 5 per cent that the WHO set as a benchmark of sorts, below which the pandemic could be deemed under control. Currently, India\\\\u2019s national average is a high 21 per cent positivity rate with some states like Goa registering as high as 49.2 per cent\\\\u2014which means that every second person tested here is found to be positive. The states that are a worry now are West Bengal, Haryana, Karnataka and Rajasthan, for they are showing positivity rates of 30 per cent and above.\\\\n\\\\nWorse, the Second Wave is now spreading rapidly to rural areas and may upset the projections of those carefully constructed models. Health ministry statistics show that on May 10, 533 of the country\\\\u2019s 718 districts had a case positivity rate of over 10 per cent. In Madhya Pradesh, 45 of the 52 districts had a positivity rate of above 10 per cent. In Uttar Pradesh, the country\\\\u2019s most populous state, 38\\\\u2014or half\\\\u2014of the 75 districts have high positivity rates. In Bihar, as many as 33 of the 38 districts are similarly impacted and in Tamil Nadu a majority of the 38 districts had high positivity rates.\\\\n\\\\nALSO READ | Ground report: How Covid-19 has affected India\\'s rural areas\\\\n\\\\nThe worry for experts is that in rural areas there is very little testing being done and no proper record of deaths. So the pandemic may rage on without reflecting in official statistics. The reports of growing numbers of the sick and dead in rural areas are the only indications that the situation is fast getting out of hand. Recent reports of a rapid fall in positivity rates in states like Bihar and UP are viewed with much scepticism by experts. As one of them said, \\\\u201cFigures don\\\\u2019t drop like the Niagara falls[the decline] either indicates that the states are doing extraordinarily well, which seems hard to believe given the condition in the rest of the country, or their testing numbers have dropped drastically.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nGiridhar Babu, professor and head, life-course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), believes that both cases and deaths are being \\\\u201cundercounted\\\\u201d across India and that the numbers impacted could be anything \\\\u201cbetween 3 to 7 times\\\\u201d what is actually being revealed. His own estimates are that instead of the official figures of an average of 350,000 cases, there are actually around 500,000-600,000 being infected daily. Shahid Jameel, director, Trivedi School of Bioscience, Ashoka University, adds, \\\\u201cThe only saving grace is that the population density is not so high in rural areas so the transmission will not be as fast as it is in cities. But the negative point is that healthcare in villages is poor.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which governs the testing regime, says in order to ramp up the current 1.9 million tests daily, it has altered its policy to allow more rapid antigen tests (RAT), especially in rural areas (earlier it had been insisting that 70 per cent cases must be tested through the RTPCR route). ICMR is pushing for deployment of mobile vans in rural areas to increase the number of RAT tests done. While RAT has a much higher rate of false negative results, it would at least give some idea of the spread of the pandemic in rural areas.\\\\n\\\\nWHEN WILL COVID 2.0 SUBSIDE?\\\\n\\\\nExperts differ on the question of how long the second wave will take to subside and infection levels to hit manageable levels. Would it drop rapidly like a cliff or taper off gradually in a series of rolling hills? Vidyasagar says, \\\\u201cIf you looked at the first wave of infections last year, it was a very gentle climb which almost went unnoticed and so was the decline. We believe the decline will not be a sheer drop but a benign process which will take a month-and-a-half before it stabilises. There would be a rapid decline from the peak till you get down to around 50,000 to 60,000 cases daily which would be the intersection point where the disease slows down.\\\\u201d Menon agrees with that conclusion and says \\\\u201cit will not balloon down as fast as it took off, so we have to be very watchful as there is a risk that new variants may come in and queer the pitch.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nTo complicate these predictions further, Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at CMC, Vellore, points out that \\\\u201cit\\\\u2019s very hard to think of an Indian peak because we are seeing multiple peaks, starting with Mumbai, then Delhi and now in the south where the peaks are just beginning. Also, you may continue to have bumps in the downward curve depending on the containment measures or the lack of them by a particular state\\\\u201d. Mukherjee agrees with Kang that India experiences \\\\u201ccascading peaks\\\\u201d across major cities but points out that \\\\u201cMaharashtra has always been the driving factor in terms of number of cases and outbreaks. India\\\\u2019s curve follows the Maharashtra curve with a bit of a lag. What we are now seeing is a slowing down in the big cities.\\\\u201d She believes the declining curve would be symmetrical to the increase as infectious diseases do have a predictable pattern that can be statistically estimated. The curve, she believes, would follow the contours of a Mexican sombrero. The good news is the Union health ministry announcement on May 10 that it saw the early trends of a plateauing of cases and a possible decline in some major cities. But this decline has to be sustained for weeks before it can be recognised as the waning of the second wave.\\\\n\\\\nWHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, how\\\\u00adever, discounts projections that the Second Wave \\\\u201cwill come down sharp just as it went up sharp\\\\u201d. She believes the diminishing of the Second Wave will be a prolonged affair. Swaminathan points out that \\\\u201cpredictions also depend on how interventions are being done. If there is a national lockdown for a couple of weeks, it will help bend the curve\\\\u201d. To illustrate her point, she cites how waves behaved in countries like the UK, US and Brazil. The UK, for instance, experienced several clear waves that subsided when the government implemented a lockdown but rose again when it opened up the country. In January, the UK imposed a prolonged lockdown and backed it with speedy vaccinations that covered much of its population. Swaminathan believes these measures will help the UK in staving off huge waves next time around.\\\\n\\\\nRead the full interview with Dr Soumya Swaminathan\\\\n\\\\nFor the US, when the second wave came, the numbers shot up really high and even when it came down it settled at a much higher level of daily cases. But because of the recent massive vaccination drive, both hospitalisations and deaths are going down. Brazil, on the other hand, lacked a clear national policy and continues to experience peaks and troughs even in areas where it thought herd immunity had developed. A clear warning for India not to follow the Brazil \\\\u2018model\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nWORRY OVER MUTANTS\\\\n\\\\nThere is a known unknown that could upset the best of pan\\\\u00addemic progression models. It is the ability of the virus to mutate into variants that can break through a person\\\\u2019s hard-won immunity even if he/ she has been vaccinated. While no major study has yet established that the newer variants were the cause of the Second Wave in India, they certainly played a large part in swelling it. The world over dozens of variants have evolved from the original Wuhan virus. Only four of them\\\\u2014originating in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India, respectively, have been labelled by the WHO as \\\\u2018variants of concern\\\\u2019, capable of causing global havoc (see graphic: Understanding Covid variants).\\\\n\\\\nIn India, during the second wave both the UK variant and the so-called \\\\u2018Indian double mutant\\\\u2019 have been found in significant percentages in samples tested. While the UK variant was found active in Punjab, the Indian variant was widely prevalent in Maharashtra. Studies so far have shown that both these strains are far more infectious than the original virus. But in terms of mortality, ICMR\\\\u2019s Bhargava says so far there is no evidence to show that these variants caused a higher number of deaths or more serious illness. What they do show is that the use of oxygen for treating patients is higher by 6 per cent, as compared to the first wave.\\\\n\\\\nApart from the progress of the infection, the biggest concern raised by the new variants is whether the two vaccinations India is using, Covishield and Covaxin, are effective against the virus. This is especially because these vaccines, like many others, were designed and developed to combat the original Wuhan virus and not its variants, as such. The worry has grown after many people who had taken either the first dose of the vaccines or the second one subsequently got infected. Researchers across the world are studying how effective the vaccines are against the newer variants of Covid-19.\\\\n\\\\nIn India, ICMR\\\\u2019s National Institute of Virology (NIV), in a recent study, showed that Covaxin is effective against both the Indian and the UK variants. NIV director Dr Priya Abraham says, \\\\u201cThe ICMR-NIV study shows that Covaxin neutralises variants of SARS-CoV-2 including the double mutant strain found in India. What this means is that while the vaccine may not always stop a person from getting infected it can prevent serious forms of Covid infection that could lead to hospitalisation and possibly deaths.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThere are reports from international laboratories that Covishield too is effective in neutralising Covid variants prevalent in India. As Shahid Jameel puts it, \\\\u201cThe cat and mouse game between humans and the virus will continue for awhile. The second wave will go down only when a sufficient number of people get exposed and develop immunity by various means, or through stringent containment measures. The virus then stays in a reservoir of people, usually acquires a mutation to evade existing immunity and then attacks again.\\\\u201d He adds: \\\\u201cIt is imperative that genomic surveillance is in place all the time in India. It can\\\\u2019t just be there by hindsight. The value of sequencing emerging variants early, before they start circulating in large numbers in the country, should not be underestimated. It will give us the capability to identify and handle the surge before it is too late.\\\\u201d With K. VijayRaghavan, the scientific advisor to the Indian government, stating that a third wave was now a given, Jameel\\\\u2019s advice becomes all the more pertinent.\\\\n\\\\nDEALING WITH THE THIRD WAVE\\\\n\\\\nEven as concerns about an imminent third wave grow, the strategy to combat it remains the same as in the second wave. The best way to get a wave of infection to subside quickly is to break the chain of transmission both through universal masking and by stringent lockdowns that minimise contact between individuals. Already 26 states in India have some sort of lockdown in place. This is beginning to bend the infection but the trend has to be sustained. Swaminathan says, \\\\u201cIt is difficult because India is a very huge and heterogenous country. To put the whole country into a lockdown has lot of implications on the livelihoods of people. We need a nationally coordinated strategy that is based on clear, transparent criteria as to when to lock down and when to lift restrictions. These must be made publicly available, apart from establishing district-level monitoring of cases and ensuring adequate health infrastructure.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nLockdowns do exact a heavy price in livelihoods, especially in India where the informal economy dominates and work from home is suitable for only a small percentage of the workforce. Gagandeep Kang says, \\\\u201cI am very reluctant to advocate lockdowns because of the human costs involved. But the wave has reached a stage where we have no choice but to stem the transmission by interrupting mobility and preventing people from coming in physical contact with others. It is important that during this period the government, NGOs and civil society support the most vulnerable sections. \\\\u201c\\\\n\\\\nExperts say the strategy is the same as it was in dealing with the first wave: beef up medical oxygen supply and beds for patients with serious symptoms, apart from ensuring availability of key medicines to treat the disease. And ramp up the vaccination programme to cover as much of the population as soon as possible. Mukherjee says, \\\\u201cYou have to solve the virus problem to revive the economyignoring it would the wrong thing to do. We have to a clear-cut strategy to rescue India. The government must candidly admit its mistakes and reassure the public that they are not going to drop the ball. That they are not going to shut down Covid care centres, oxygen production or be sluggish with vaccination. These may cost money but will in the long run prevent the economy from getting crushed and we\\\\u2019ll not have to see the humanitarian crisis we are now facing.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s the plan? PM Modi at a virtual meeting with members of the Covid crisis group, May 2\\\\n\\\\nExperts also advocate ramping up the vaccination strategy as a most important preventive measure against future serious Covid outbreaks. Giridhar Babu says that given our reputation of being the world\\\\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer, the government should now go all out to invite international companies to come and manufacture Covid vaccines at Indian facilities, and to not just supply to India but export to the world. Babu says, \\\\u201cThis is the opportunity for the Modi government to create a turnaround story and push the Make in India campaign more vigorously. It must pull out all the stops, spend money to get the best companies to come here, utilise our existing manufacturing capabilities and also set up new ones.\\\\u201d Gautam Menon says the top priority in the coming months must be to aggressively vaccinate the above 44 years age group where Covid mortality is highest as are serious illnesses.\\\\n\\\\nShahid Jameel is clear that \\\\u201cthe third wave will come but no one can predict when. Its impact will depend on how many people are vaccinated, what sort of mutation the virus acquires between now and the third wave and how much we have improved our health infrastructure to meet the crisis as well as educate the people to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour\\\\u201d. Kang agrees and says the key is to build surge capacity in health infrastructure that acts as an insurance policy against future waves. \\\\u201cThat we will get multiple waves after this is certain,\\\\u201d she says. \\\\u201cBut we don\\\\u2019t know if it will be a larger peak, and it could happen if the virus undergoes huge changes. But, in general, most viruses adapt after several years to becoming something like influenza which spreads easily but is less virulent.\\\\u201d Till such time, she says \\\\u201cIndia must never let its guard down again\\\\u201d.

Predictably, the economic toll has also been heavy, though nothing like the carnage seen in the first quarter of the last fiscal year, when GDP growth crashed -23.9 per cent in response to the Centre\\\\u2019s no-notice lockdown.\\\\n\\\\nA major concern of the second wave is that the virus has spread into India\\\\u2019s hinterland and could wreak havoc in villages, towns and small cities. Lockdowns might help break the chain of transmission, but they will only postpone another surge unless the period is used to urgently vaccinate the population. The economic cost will depend on how quickly this happens\\\\u2014and the news on that front is not too promising (see Shots in the Dark, page 32)\\\\u2014and how quickly economic activity can return to an uninhibited normal.\\\\n\\\\nIt has been clear for some time now\\\\u2014at least since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on April 20 that national lockdowns should be a \\\\u201clast resort\\\\u201d\\\\u2014that it was being left to state governments to manage their own Covid-containment strategies. In April, Finance Minister Nirmala\\\\n\\\\nSitharaman also reached out to business leaders to assure them that there would be no repeat of 2020\\\\u2019s national shutdown, but that\\\\u2019s what it is willy-nilly, with most states forced to impose restrictions on movement and non-essential economic activity. What distinguishes this year from the last is that key businesses are being permitted to operate in several states, with state and national highways open for the uninterrupted transport of essential goods. Industry leaders also seem in favour of the current system, arguing for strict restrictions on the movement of people to contain the virus, but not a lockdown directed by the Centre. \\\\u201cState-level decisions are better than a one-size-fits-all approach,\\\\u201d argues an industrialist.\\\\n\\\\nKey industrialised have implemented severe restrictions. These include Maharashtra, which accounts for over 14 per cent of India\\\\u2019s GDP. With the highest number of cases in both the first and second waves of the pandemic, the state currently has lockdown-like conditions on weekdays and a complete shutdown on weekends. These are currently in force till May 31. They are both supported by business leaders and seem to be working\\\\u2014new cases were down to 37,236 on May 11 from 67,468 cases on April 22. \\\\u201cThe restrictions in Mahatrashtra have been appropriate for the conditions we have had,\\\\u201d Naushad Forbes, chairman of Forbes Marshall, tells INDIA TODAY. \\\\u201cThey were practical and correctly targeted.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nALSO READ | Lockdowns 2.0: Lives win over livelihoods\\\\n\\\\nIn Maharashtra, most industries remain operational, adhering to strict Covid protocols and with lower employee headcounts. The problem is the fall in demand\\\\u2014one of the reasons for smaller workforces\\\\u2014as a result of markets, malls, cinemas and theatres and shops selling non-essential goods being closed. Even those selling essential goods face restrictions, permitted to operate only between 7 am and 11 am on weekdays. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers Association of India, says large retailers have adapted, investing in digital infrastructure to facilitate online ordering and delivery. However, given that e-commerce is only permitted for essential goods and that hundreds of thousands of small entrepreneurs do not have online delivery models, the restrictions have had a lethal impact on business.\\\\n\\\\nFurther south, in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (the last two of which recently concluded assembly elections with no Covid protocols in sight), complete lockdowns are currently in force\\\\u2014in Kerala till May 16 and in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu till May 24. In the north, Delhi has extended its lockdown till May 17, while Rajasthan is closed till May 25. While cases surge, state governments have no choice but to maintain these restrictions\\\\u2014lifting them would cause much worse damage. \\\\u201cHealth outcomes will determine India\\\\u2019s economic outcomes,\\\\u201d says Forbes, highlighting that quickly vaccinating the public is essential to even protect the economy from the pandemic.\\\\n\\\\nWhen saving lives is paramount, it is natural for economic matters to take a back seat. But a situation in which jobs or other livelihoods are vulnerable cannot but affect the economy. The toll is already rising swiftly. A study by research firm CMIE (the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) says India lost 3.4 million salaried jobs in April this year, with almost nine million salaried jobs lost over two months from February. Employment dropped from 82.2 million in February to 76.7 million in March and 73.3 million in April. Total employment is currently about 12.5 million below the average for 2019-20 (85.9 million), before Covid-19 first hit, and just above the average for 2020-21 (72.5 million), the first year of the pandemic. This means the Covid restrictions this year may already have wiped out the gains the job market saw at the end of last year. \\\\u201cWhile there initially was a recovery from the sharp job losses in categories like daily wage earners, farmers and the self-employed, the count of salaried employees has been falling,\\\\u201d Mahesh Vyas, MD & CEO of CMIE, told INDIA TODAY.\\\\n\\\\nALSO READ | Can RBI\\\\u2019s new measures provide real succour to Covid-hit firms?\\\\n\\\\nVarious agencies have already begun lowering their forecasts for India\\\\u2019s GDP growth in the current fiscal. Global brokerage firm Barclays cut its estimate to 10 per cent from the earlier projection of 11 per cent, saying the slow pace of vaccinations and the uncertainty around the true number of cases and deaths in the second wave were triggers. India\\\\u2019s losses, it estimates, could be $38.4 billion if lockdowns continued till June; if restrictions are in place till August, GDP growth could fall to as low as 8.8 per cent.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, on May 5, that people and businesses have learnt to live with localised lockdowns and that the impact on demand would not be as severe as last year, reports from the ground show a drop in demand for FMCG products (fast moving consumer goods), consumer durables, automobiles and so on. Reflecting India Inc\\\\u2019s worries over lockdowns, a Dun & Bradstreet survey says business optimism for the second quarter of calendar year 2021 fell 23 per cent compared to the first quarter.\\\\n\\\\nRatings firm Crisil, which had earlier forecast 11 per cent GDP growth in the current fiscal year, now talks of two probable scenarios. The first assumes the second wave of Covid cases peaks by end-May, with lockdowns having a moderate impact on business, leaving the economy growing at about 9.8 per cent. In the second scenario, the second wave peaks only by end-June, with lockdowns having a severe impact and GDP growth falling to 8.2 per cent. In either case, Crisil believes that economic activity in the first half of this fiscal year will be clouded by the pandemic, but that the second half should see growth, led by increased vaccinations and the public adapting better to lockdowns. It adds that global growth in the second half of the year could support India\\\\u2019s exports. Among corporate sectors, those most impacted will be airlines, hotels, media & entertainment, organised retail and firms dealing with discretionary products such as cars and two-wheelers (see The Covid Impact on Corporate Revenues). Overall, revenues in corporate India are expected to grow by about 15 per cent in 2021-22, compared to -8 per cent in 2020-21.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, S&P Global Ratings has slashed India\\\\u2019s GDP growth forecast for this year to 9.8 per cent, saying the second wave of Covid-19 cases could derail a nascent recovery and worsen credit conditions. \\\\u201cIndia\\\\u2019s second wave has prompted us to reconsider our forecast of 11 per cent GDP growth this fiscal year,\\\\u201dsaid Shaun Roache, S&P Global Ratings chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region. \\\\u201cThe timing of the peak in cases, and subsequent rate of decline, drives our considerations.\\\\u201d The firm\\\\u2019s earlier estimate had GDP growing at 11 per cent on account of the quick re-opening of the economy after the first wave and the Centre\\\\u2019s fiscal stimulus. However, the second wave, hitting young potential earners, will impact both urban and rural demand. \\\\u201cThis time, the middle class is worried [about making it through the pandemic],\\\\u201d says an economist, not wanting to be named. \\\\u201cThat has a very deep impact on consumption patterns. I always say that there are only 250 million real consumers in India, despite the total population. The first wave spared the 250 million, but the second wave has hit them hard.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nWhat also distinguishes the second wave from the first is that its impact will be felt strongly in rural areas. The first wave was largely an urban phenomenon, but with cases now appearing in rural districts with already-compromised infrastructure, the impact could be serious. Nearly 70 per cent of India\\\\u2019s workforce lives in rural areas, according to an estimate by the Niti Aayog. Moreover, the rural economy accounts for 46 per cent of the country\\\\u2019s national income. In 2020, the rural economy offered some hope in the face of broadbased economic chaos.\\\\n\\\\nPradeep Kashyap, founding member of the Rural Marketing Association of India and founder of MART Global Management Solutions, says though the agriculture sector is expected to grow this year, it won\\\\u2019t be the saviour it was last year. He reckons that the farm sector could grow about two per cent, but says that during this round of lockdowns, migrant workers have returned to their villages without savings, which means there will be no boost to rural demand, unlike last year. The direct impact of Covid\\\\u2014with family breadwinners also falling sick\\\\u2014will be felt despite job guarantee schemes like MGNREGA. This is a double whammy since it impacts both savings and health. Making matters worse, rural areas are lagging when it comes to vaccinations. \\\\u201cThis time, the rural economy will not be a saviour,\\\\u201d argues Kashyap.\\\\n\\\\nEntrepreneurs say the fear of Covid is palpable among their workers, who worry both about falling ill and losing their jobs. \\\\u201cWe regularly talk to our workers and assure them that we will stand by them in this hour of crisis,\\\\u201d says Vipul Dawar, MD at Dehradun-based Indo German Brakes. They say the uncertainty and unpredictability of localised lockdowns is also adding to their stress. \\\\u201cIf the government wants to impose a complete lockdown, let it do so,\\\\u201d says Rahul Ahuja, MD of Ludhiana-based Rajneesh Industries. \\\\u201cThat clarity would allow us to plan much better.\\\\u201d (Punjab is partially locked down till May 15.) Hospitality is again among the worst hit sectors.

And [because of the second wave and lockdowns] we are back to square one,\\\\u201d says Manu Kochhar, promoter of Madhuban hotels in Uttarakhand. The state government, already in the dock for permitting the Kumbh Mela, which turned into a super spreader event, has cancelled the Char Dham Yatra, which was scheduled to begin May 10. Businesses are trapped between saving lives and livelihoods. \\\\u201cWe can\\\\u2019t let go of our staff.

This time, it has been more careful. \\\\u201cEconomic management has been better this time,\\\\u201d says former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. \\\\u201cThere is no panic. Interventions have been nuanced and several economic activities have been exempted from lockdowns [because] the cost of not doing so was also high (for instance, in e-commerce).\\\\u201d From a sectoral perspective, Kashyap says agriculture will probably grow at about two per cent this fiscal, electricity data is suggesting higher consumption than in 2019 and that IT, e-commerce and pharmaceutical companies are seeing increased demand. Another economist explains that the second wave\\\\u2019s impact on the formal sector could be muted because systems are in place to adapt to the changes. \\\\u201cNo state has imposed restrictions on manufacturing\\\\u2014it is the consumer demand that I am concerned about,\\\\u201d he says, requesting anonymity.\\\\n\\\\nThis time, the challenges facing the economy (and especially rural areas) are different. Experts say that providing rations and direct benefit transfers could soften the blow. In terms of stimulating demand, many middle-class Indian families have recently spent lakhs of rupees on medical treatment and safety measures against Covid. Experts say the government defraying these costs somehow could go a long way. Sources also say that the RBI, with officials from the finance ministry, are working on new relief measures for stressed borrowers in case the lockdowns are prolonged. \\\\u201cWe are keeping a close watch,\\\\u201d says a top official in the finance ministry. Further, with GST (goods and services tax) collections going up, the government should also consider lowering tax rates, says an economist. Sources say the government will wait and see how the storm progresses before announcing relief measures. For now, it has to focus on strengthening its vaccination drives, especially in the rural towns and villages, which look highly vulnerable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2014with Anilesh S.

Later that night, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was leading the BJP\\\\u2019s campaign, sat listening to the 30-minute-long conversation playing on a cell phone of one of his aides. A local Congress leader present at the guest house had secretly recorded the conversation. This incident reflects to what extent Sarma went to ensure a victory for the BJP, a party he joined after quitting the Congress in 2015. Rahul Gandhi had declined to make Sarma chief minister of Assam in place of the incumbent Tarun Gogoi at the time.\\\\n\\\\nSix years after leaving the Congress, Sarma took oath as the 15th chief minister of Assam after delivering a second consecutive victory for the BJP in the state\\\\u2019s assembly poll. While a two-decade-long commitment to the Congress could not convince the party brass of his eligibility to helm the state, the BJP wised up to Sarma\\\\u2019s abilities within six years. More significantly, the BJP replaced the incumbent chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, even though the party returned to power based on the performance of his government. This unprecedented move demonstrates the importance of Sarma not only in the politics of Assam and the Northeast, but also in the larger game plan of the BJP and its \\\\u2018ideological fountainhead\\\\u2019, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\\\\n\\\\nThe party realised that more than the Sonowal government\\\\u2019s performance, the driving force behind the BJP\\\\u2019s electoral victory was Sarma\\\\u2019s track record of almost 20 years as an efficient minister both in the Congress and BJP governments, along with his mastery at winning elections and in crisis management. As the health minister, he not only ramped up health infrastructure in the state by adding three new medical college hospitals\\\\u2014four more, including an AIIMS, are under construction\\\\u2014but also brought in several people-friendly measures, like making it mandatory for medical graduates to serve one year in rural areas for admission in PG courses. As education minister, Sarma introduced a transparent common written test in 2011 to recruit over 200,000 teachers.\\\\n\\\\nBut his superb management of the first wave of Covid last year gained him unparalleled popularity among the masses. He not only visited ICUs, crematoriums and quarantine centres across the state, but monitored every development and personally responded to every call for help through social media or over the phone. During the election campaign, people jostled to get a glimpse of Sarma, to touch him or take a selfie with him. And after a young girl wrote an emotional poem dedicated to him, in which she referred to him as \\\\u201cmama\\\\u201d, Sarma became the universal \\\\u201cmama\\\\u201d to Assam\\\\u2019s younger generation.\\\\n\\\\nThe shrewd political leader, though, understands that such popularity can be short-lived. \\\\u201cIf I make a mistake tomorrow, people will forget the past,\\\\u201d says Sarma. However, his political network and the loyalty of his followers within the party are secure. He may have been in the BJP for just six years, but his grip on the party organisation and personal equation with the RSS, which was initially wary of his style of functioning, is unmatched. He came to the BJP with 10 Congress MLAs, but on May 9, 45 of the 60 BJP MLAs in the state backed him for chief minister in place of Sonowal. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s because he believes in winning friends. He helps even those who have plotted against him. And for his loyalists, he can go to any extent to protect them, even at the cost of his own career,\\\\u201d says Pijush Hazarika, a minister in Sarma\\\\u2019s cabinet and his most trusted lieutenant for two decades.\\\\n\\\\nSarma also entered the RSS\\\\u2019s good books by showing unwavering commitment to its ideology. From being the most vocal supporter of the RSS-backed CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), which provoked massive popular protest from Assamese citizens, to shutting down government-sponsored madrassas and taking a public stand against Miya poetry (written in a dialect spoken by immigrant Muslims), he did everything to impress the RSS brass. \\\\u201cHe doesn\\\\u2019t take a personal stand. Whatever is the party position, Sarma remains committed to taking it to its logical conclusion. Besides, he is always accessible to every member and cadre of the BJP and RSS, even at odd hours,\\\\u201d says RSS leader Ram Madhav, who was instrumental in bringing Sarma to the BJP. Few are aware of the Sarma family\\\\u2019s long-time association with the RSS. As a teenager, he regularly visited RSS shakhas, while his elder brother\\\\u2019s education was supported by them. Unsurprisingly, right after taking oath as chief minister, Sarma visited the RSS office in Guwahati and held a meeting with the senior RSS leaders in the state.\\\\n\\\\nSarma also enjoys a large following among the non-political and non-aligned, particularly those who were influenced by him during his three terms as general secretary of the students\\\\u2019 union of Cotton College, Assam\\\\u2019s most prestigious educational institution and the alma mater of seven earlier chief ministers. These former students, who are influencers in their respective professional arenas, have an emotional attachment to their \\\\u201cdada\\\\u201d .\\\\n\\\\nBesides Assam, Sarma\\\\u2019s personal relationships across party lines have been instrumental in the BJP\\\\u2019s expansion in the Northeast. From engineering Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu\\\\u2019s defection to the BJP and running the campaign in Manipur and Tripura, to stitching winning alliances in Meghalaya and Nagaland, Sarma helped the party grab power in a region where the demography was not organically suited to its Hindutva politics. Nationalist People\\\\u2019s Party chief and Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K. Sangma openly acknowledges Sarma\\\\u2019s role in his own political journey. \\\\u201cHe is an elder brother to me and has guided me politically and personally. His ability to understand a complex situation and then always find a solution amazes me,\\\\u201d says Sangma.\\\\n\\\\nWhat has also worked in Sarma\\\\u2019s favour is the party\\\\u2019s debacle in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, which simultaneously went to polls. He shone in contrast. Also, the public outrage against the Modi government\\\\u2019s failure to anticipate the Covid second wave and its harrowing ongoing consequences made the BJP leadership wary of any turmoil within. More importantly, even the Congress had sent out feelers saying it was ready to make Sarma chief minister if he defected from the BJP with the required number of MLAs. \\\\u201cHe is a political animal. Only power matters to him. I think the BJP realised this when they dumped Sonowal,\\\\u201d says Digvijaya Singh, one of Sarma\\\\u2019s mentors in the Congress.\\\\n\\\\nSarma\\\\u2019s anointment on May 10 has been the culmination of a four-decade-long political journey that he began in the 1980s as something of a \\\\u2018boy wonder\\\\u2019, taking active part in the Assam agitation against illegal infiltrators. As a teenager, he learnt his first political lessons by shadowing Prafulla Mahanta and Bhrigu Phukan, two towering AASU leaders who later went on to become chief minister and home minister, respectively. In 1994, he joined the Congress and made his mark as an able administrator and electoral strategist under the patronage of two chief ministers\\\\u2014Hiteswar Saikia and Tarun Gogoi.\\\\n\\\\nNow, as chief minister, Sarma doesn\\\\u2019t want to leave any room for dissent. Three Sonowal loyalists have found place in his cabinet. In contrast, just one of the 10 MLAs who had switched with him from the Congress to BJP has been given a ministry. He is also making symbolic statements\\\\u2014he visited Sonowal with all his cabinet members on May 12 and appointed a woman finance minister.\\\\n\\\\nWith the state in the grip of a raging pandemic, Sarma doesn\\\\u2019t have the luxury of a honeymoon period. His immediate priority is to save lives. However, his long-term priority seems to be to bring in a permanent solution to Assam\\\\u2019s perennial flood problem. That\\\\u2019s why the ministry of water resources has gone to his man Friday, Pijush Hazarika. Sarma also has to pay attention to the financial crunch the state faces and the party\\\\u2019s electoral promises\\\\u2014like waiving the Rs 12,000 microfinance loans taken by poor women in self-help groups and providing 100,000 government jobs by 2022. Sarma has already formed cabinet committees to implement these promises. \\\\u201cTo those worried about the treasury, let me say we are in sound fiscal health,\\\\u201d Sarma says with his usual nonchalance.\\\\n\\\\nSuch bravado, however, has landed him in trouble on occasion. For instance, while campaigning, he declared that there was no need for masks because there was no corona in the state. It was meant to assure prospective voters that there would be no restrictive measures during Bihu celebrations following the election. It may have earned him political dividends, but the statement, coming from a health minister, was highly irresponsible and went viral on social media. \\\\u201cI admit Ma Saraswati takes leave of me at times,\\\\u201d says Sarma.\\\\n\\\\nSuch slips may prove costly for the new chief minister. Given his performance record, people\\\\u2019s expectations from him are high. There will be little margin for error.\\\\n\\\\nMeet the new boss Himanta Biswa Sarma, 52 Educational qualification: PhD, MA in Political Science, LLB Assets: Rs 17 crore Family: Late father Kailash Nath Sarma was an eminent writer; mother Mrinalini Devi is the vicepresident of Asom Sahitya Sabha, the largest literary body in Assam; wife Riniki Bhuyan owns a media house; son Nandil is preparing for law; and\\\\n\\\\ndaughter Sukanya is in school.

Inspired by the life of an erotica writer, Mastram featured several sex scenes, and Cutting\\\\u2019s job was to ensure they happened as smoothly as possible. Then, last September, India got its first certified intimacy coordinator in Aastha Khanna, fresh from a 16-week-long training course from the Intimacy Professionals Association. An assistant director, Khanna stumbled into this niche when she realised there was no dedicated professional on the job. \\\\u201cThe idea is to help the director realise their vision, while making sure that the actors\\\\u2019 boundaries are upheld and at no point is anyone\\\\u2019s consent flouted,\\\\u201d she says. She now has several upcoming projects, including with Netflix, Amazon Prime and Dharma Productions.\\\\n\\\\nAastha Khanna, Intimacy Coordinator\\\\n\\\\nIndian cinema has moved on from suggestive foot movements and creative use of foliage as a stand-in for on-screen sex to realistic, unabashed depictions in shows like Made in Heaven, Four More Shots Please! and Sacred Games. As the industry has shed its inhibitions, the culture around shooting these scenes, too, has evolved. From hiring intimacy specialists and holding workshops and consent conversations, to using safe words while shooting, filmmakers and studios are taking nascent steps towards ensuring actors feel comfortable and safe while filming sex scenes. \\\\u201cThree years ago, the [intimacy coordinator] job did not exist even in the West,\\\\u201d says Khanna. As an outcome of the MeToo movement and disclosures of major Hollywood actresses, the HBO show Deuce was among the first to hire an intimacy consultant in 2018. These professionals are now mandatory in all of HBO\\\\u2019s shows.\\\\n\\\\nKhanna\\\\u2019s job entails conducting workshops with actors, creating ground rules for shooting, checking comfort levels and arranging for protective wear. Intimate scenes are broken down technically and carefully choreographed, not shot in a burst of spontaneity. \\\\u201cChemistry is something that actors can bring when they have trust in each other,\\\\u201d she says.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike with dance choreographers and stunt directors, actors often don\\\\u2019t even know that sex scenes can have specialists. \\\\u201cI realised there was not much effort being put in to create a safe space for actors on set,\\\\u201d says Neha Vyas, an actor, producer and \\\\u2018intimacy designer\\\\u2019, now working towards certification as a coordinator. \\\\u201cBecause of the way we [actors] are trained, we treat ourselves like that. We don\\\\u2019t realise that our boundaries or consent have value.\\\\u201d Vyas worked as an intimacy designer for the film Bodies of Desire and has conducted workshops for actors. \\\\u201cMy attempt is usually to move actors from thinking about their bodies as objects to treating their bodies as instruments,\\\\u201d she says.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes actors may be willing to go further than the director anticipates. Other times they may be hesitant, so workarounds are needed\\\\u2014shooting close-ups, using creative angles or body doubles. Actors have also told Khanna that it helps if they have more time to build trust with their co-actors or if they can shoot without a break. She is now working on guidelines for best practices on film sets, including the role of an intimacy specialist.\\\\n\\\\nDirectors, too, are taking extra steps. In an interview, filmmaker Alankrita Shrivastava and cinematographer Jay Oza described building a rapport with actors and avoiding multiple takes during the shoot of Made in Heaven. Before shooting Margarita with a Straw, director Shonali Bose was determined her actors feel safe and unselfconscious. So Kalki Koechlin and Sayani Gupta did an intimacy workshop along with Bose where they gently explored boundaries. The day Gupta had to take off her shirt, the closed set had just a handful of women. Bose, too, took her top off and directed with a towel around her waist. \\\\u201cIf you are the only one nude, you feel vulnerable,\\\\u201d she says. \\\\u201cTo have the most powerful person in the room, the director, also be nude immediately lessens the tension.\\\\u201d Following a sex scene, Bose herself rushed to give the actors their dressing gowns.\\\\n\\\\nFrank discussions and thoughtful preparation also have a knock-on effect on the film itself, averting schlocky, clich\\\\u00e9d on-screen sex or exploitative framing. \\\\u201cWhile talking about the MeToo movement, gender identity, sexuality and parity, you don\\\\u2019t have an intimacy coach or coordinator, you are doing a disservice not just to the actors but to the aesthetic of the film,\\\\u201d says Vyas.\\\\n\\\\nBose specifically wanted a woman director of photography for Margarita, partly to avoid a reductive gaze on the women. \\\\u201cWhat we were conscious of and added to making the actors comfortable was knowing they are not being objectified,\\\\u201d she says, but \\\\u201cwe are capturing something beautiful... in a respectful, progressive way.\\\\u201d n\\\\n\\\\nInside an intimacy consultant\\\\u2019s kit\\\\n\\\\nAastha Khanna\\\\u2019s suitcase is prepared with things an intimacy scene may require. She often fashions protective devices herself Modesty Garments and barriers These include cricketing L guards, silicone filler-based protective wear and foam barriers that are made from yoga mats and then affixed inside underwear Pilates balls When half-inflated, these \\\\u201cwork as an air pocket between the two actors\\\\u201d as \\\\u201cgenitals are not supposed to touch each other\\\\u201d and to \\\\u201cprevent arousal non-concordance\\\\u201d Nail files To save co-actors from serious injury should they get scratched accidentally Other items...

Appeals by other countries showed no sign of progress.\\\\n\\\\nThomas-Greenfield warned that the return to armed conflict would only put a negotiated two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict even further out of reach. However, the United States, Israel\\\\u2019s closest ally, has so far blocked days of efforts by China, Norway and Tunisia to get the Security Council to issue a statement, including a call for the cessation of hostilities.\\\\n\\\\nIn Israel, Hady Amr, a deputy assistant dispatched by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to try to de-escalate the crisis, met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who thanked the U.S. for its support.\\\\n\\\\nBlinken himself headed out on an unrelated tour of Nordic countries, with no announced plans to stop in the Middle East in response to the crisis. He made calls from the plane to Egypt and other nations working to broker a cease-fire, telling Egypt that all parties \\\\u201cshould de-escalate tensions and bring a halt to the violence.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nRep. Adam Schiff, Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, urged Biden on Sunday to step up pressure on both sides to end current fighting and revive talks to resolve Israel\\\\u2019s conflicts and flashpoints with the Palestinians.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence, bring about a cease-fire, end these hostilities, and get back to a process of trying to resolve this long-standing conflict,\\\\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat, told CBS\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cFace the Nation.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAnd Sen.

Thomas-Greenfield said U.S. diplomats were engaging with Israel, Egypt and Qatar, along with the U.N.\\\\n\\\\nIsraeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, medics said, bringing the toll since Hamas and Israel opened their air and artillery battles to at least 188 killed in Gaza and eight in Israel.

That will \\\\u201ctake time,\\\\u201d Netanyahu said, signaling the war would rage on for now.\\\\n\\\\nRepresentatives of Muslim nations met to demand Israel halt attacks that are killing Palestinian civilians in the crowded Gaza strip. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called on \\\\u201cthe international community to take urgent action to immediately stop military operations.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe meeting of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation also saw Turkey and some others criticize a U.S.-backed push under which the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other Islamic nations signed bilateral deals with Israel to normalize their relations, stepping over the wreckage of collapsed international efforts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians long-term.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe massacre of Palestinian children today follows the purported normalization,\\\\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. t\\\\n\\\\nAt the virtual meeting of the Security Council, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the U.N was actively engaging all parties for an immediate cease-fire.\\\\n\\\\nReturning to the scenes of Palestinian militant rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes in the fourth such war between Israel and Hamas, \\\\u201conly perpetuates the cycles of death, destruction and despair, and pushes farther to the horizon any hopes of coexistence and peace,\\\\u201d Guterres said.\\\\n\\\\nEight foreign ministers spoke at the Security Council session, reflecting the seriousness of the conflict, with almost all urging an end to the fighting.\\\\n\\\\nBiden\\\\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, had thrown US support solidly behind Israel, embracing Netanyahu as an ally in Trump\\\\u2019s focus on confronting Iran.

The Facebook-owned app will not terminate certain functionalities for these users.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWhile the majority of users have already approved our update, no one will lose functionality on May 15 if they haven\\\\u2019t yet and we\\\\u2019ll be sure to provide reminders at a later time,\\\\u201d a WhatsApp spokesperson told Mint.\\\\n\\\\nWhile WhatsApp is no longer going to limit the functionality of its app for both Android and iOS platforms, it is still going to pester users who have not accepted the privacy policy changes. If you are one of these users, you will keep seeing random pop-ups whenever you open WhatsApp on your phone. The pop-up reminds you to accept the privacy policy and that it is important for the company to serve you better. Ever since Facebook sparked off the debate over user privacy with the new changes that will collect more data about you than before, privacy advocates have lambasted Facebook. Not just them, various governments, including that of India, have asked WhatsApp to reconsider its new privacy policy. But both Facebook and WhatsApp have maintained their stance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cWe want everyone to know that this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages. We\\\\u2019re providing information about new options we are building to communicate with businesses that people may choose to use in the future,\\\\u201d the spokesperson added.\\\\n\\\\nExcept for those who live in Europe, the entire user base of WhatsApp will eventually need to accept the privacy policy. And even if WhatsApp has receded in terms of compelling its users into a do-or-die-like situation, it will not stop asking them from agreeing to the new privacy policy. It is possible that you may start seeing these prompts about accepting the privacy policy on Instagram and Facebook, although the company has not said anything about this. But you never know what Facebook can do, especially with the heap of data it already has on you.\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/whatsapp_pixabay_0-647x363.jpeg?bUf1G._42VajN3ZOEaTxCYsaPn73oHuM\", \"movies\": [\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sUBETveHt2s\"]}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1080141, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/realme-gt-neo-flash-edition-may-be-in-works-to-feature-65w-fast-charging-1803352-2021-05-17', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': True, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T04:51:50.038654Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/realme-gt-neo-flash-edition-may-be-in-works-to-feature-65w-fast-charging-1803352-2021-05-17\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-17 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"Realme GT Neo debuted in China in late March. And then, for quite some time, rumours were rife that the GT Neo would arrive in India. Although a major chunk of leaks now point out that Realme will launch X7 Max 5G as its first Dimensity 1200-powered phone in India, it is going to be more or less the same as GT Neo smartphone. Now, away from all this, Realme may be working on bringing another GT smartphone to its flagship series. This upcoming phone may be the Realme GT Neo Flash Edition, where the word Flash will stand for 65W fast charging.\\\\n\\\\nThe regular Realme GT Neo comes with 50W fast charging, despite being a member of the GT flagship range. And now that GT Neo Flash Edition is reportedly in the works, the order of phones in the GT series -- as well as Realme\\\\u2019s strategy for its top-end phones -- is becoming clear. Realme GT Neo Flash Edition is going to be nothing but a GT Neo given the power of 65W fast charging. The 65W fast charging has been a standard for fast charging on Realme and Oppo smartphones for a long time. Their smartphones across price ranges come with this technology, and it is also one of the best in the market if you talk about battery charging.\\\\n\\\\nThe rumour around the Realme GT Neo Flash Edition comes courtesy of a Weibo tipster, and he has talked about the existence of the phone and its main ingredient, which is the 65W fast charging. We do not currently know when the Realme GT Neo Flash Edition will arrive, but seeing Realme\\\\u2019s pace of launching phones, it may not be too far.\\\\n\\\\nIf the Realme GT Neo Flash Edition is another variant with better fast charging technology, the rest of the specifications are going to be the same as the regular one. This means the Realme GT Neo Flash Edition will come with a MediaTek Dimensity 1200 processor inside that will give it 5G connectivity. There are up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. And in case you want more storage, you can add a microSD card to this phone. It runs Android 11-based Realme UI 2.0 out-of-the-box. There will be a 4500mAh battery on the GT Neo Flash Edition. The phone will sport a 6.43-inch Full-HD+ Super AMOLED display with support for up to 120Hz refresh rate.\\\\n\\\\nAs for photography, you may have a 64-megapixel main Sony IMX682 sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro sensor on the back. Realme ditched the fourth sensor on the GT Neo, which is also why we are going to see just three sensors on the upcoming GT Neo Flash Edition. For selfies, the new phone may sport a 32-megapixel front camera in a punch-hole setup. The phone may also follow the design of the GT Neo if it does not want to look different.\\\\n\\\\nRealme\\\\u2019s strategy to bring a new GT Neo Flash Edition seems pointless. Had the regular GT Neo been equipped with 65W fast charging, there would be no need for a new edition.\", \"top_image\": \"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202105/realme_gt_neo_press_1200x768-647x363.jpeg?4jD2OzxMJGqvtnd9Aiqw8QbP3BeBwQZy\", \"movies\": [\"//www.youtube.com/embed/sUBETveHt2s\"]}', 'is_analyzed': False, 'search_source': 8}, {'id': 1080143, 'source_link': 'https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/celebrity/story/miss-universe-2020-is-mexico-s-andrea-meza-india-s-adline-castelino-finishes-fourth-1803360-2021-05-17', 'classified_category': None, 'tags_list': '[]', 'address': None, 'geolocation': None, 'has_media': False, 'media_link': None, 'updated_at': '2021-05-17T04:51:50.038703Z', 'meta_json': '{\"url\": \"https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/celebrity/story/miss-universe-2020-is-mexico-s-andrea-meza-india-s-adline-castelino-finishes-fourth-1803360-2021-05-17\", \"authors\": [], \"publish_date\": \"2021-05-17 00:00:00\", \"text\": \"26-year-old Andrea Meza from Mexico has won the Miss Universe 2020 crown.

              "'The Brooklyn Nets enter Sunday nightâ€™s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a chance to lock up the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, and with the trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving leading the way, they have obvious championship aspirations heading into the postseason.\\n\\nAfter the Nets rolled to a 105-91 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night, Irving, who was fined last week for repeated failure to meet with the media, took an interesting approach with reporters this time around by saying basketball isnâ€™t his main focus right now because of everything going on in the world, including the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\\n\\n\"Iâ€™m not going to lie to you guys, a lot of stuff is going on in this world, and basketball is just not the most important thing to me right now,\" Irving said, via ESPN . \"Thereâ€™s a lot of things going on overseas. All our people are still in bondage across the world, and thereâ€™s a lot of dehumanization going on.\"\\n\\nIrving continued: \"So I apologize if Iâ€™m not going to be focused on yâ€™all questions. Itâ€™s just too much going on in the world for me to just be talking about basketball. I focus on this most of the time, 24/7, but itâ€™s just too much going on in this world not to address. Itâ€™s just sad to see this s--t going on. Itâ€™s not just in Palestine, not just in Israel. Itâ€™s all over the world, and I feel it. Iâ€™m very compassionate to it â€“ to all races, all cultures and to see it, to see a lot of people being discriminated against, based on their religion, color of their skin, what they believe in. Itâ€™s just sad.\"\\n\\nAS REGULAR SEASON ENDS, NBA\\'S PLAY-IN GAMES TAKE SHAPE\\n\\nWhen Irving was asked about balancing basketball and attending to social issues across the globe, he responded by saying that \"itâ€™s a job\" but added that \"you canâ€™t be afraid to say what you believe in.\"\\n\\n\"I was raised as a survivor,\" Irving continued. \"My family comes from practically the bottom in the South Bronx. They came out of some extreme conditions. I\\'m the product of a lot of sacrifice. ... It\\'s a unique balance because you\\'re on a platform or industry that â€“ a lot of people that are around it or surviving it don\\'t really get a chance to say what they believe in, or they have to play it safe, or they have to worry about money, or they have to worry about what people are saying.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"It\\'s not about consuming information or trying to be right or politically correct. It\\'s about doing what God intends us all to do â€“ that\\'s to stand on the good word of treating everyone with respect, compassion and love.\"\\n\\nThe Nets will secure the second seed if they beat the Cavaliers on Sunday night. Entering the matchup, Irving is averaging 27.1 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.7 rebounds for Brooklyn.'"
